//! Storage trait surface — MR-793.
//!
//! `TableStorage` is the engine-internal trait that exposes the
//! staged-write primitives (`stage_append`, `stage_merge_insert`,
//! `stage_overwrite`, `stage_create_btree_index`,
//! `stage_create_inverted_index`) plus `commit_staged` as the canonical
//! way for new engine writers to advance Lance HEAD without coupling
//! "write bytes" with "advance HEAD" in one Lance API call.
//!
//! ## Inline-commit residuals live on a separate trait
//!
//! The inline-commit writes that Lance cannot yet express as
//! stage-then-commit are NOT on `TableStorage`. They sit on
//! [`InlineCommitResidual`], reachable only via
//! `Omnigraph::storage_inline_residual()`, so the default `db.storage()`
//! surface is staged-only and cannot couple "write bytes" with "advance
//! HEAD" — MR-793 acceptance §1 closes by construction. The sole remaining
//! residual:
//!
//! * `create_vector_index` — segment-commit-path needs
//!   `build_index_metadata_from_segments`, still `pub(crate)` in Lance
//!   7.0.0 ([#6666](https://github.com/lance-format/lance/issues/6666),
//!   open). Scalar indices already stage.
//!
//! `delete_where` was the other residual until MR-A: Lance 7.0's
//! `DeleteBuilder::execute_uncommitted` (#6658) made delete a staged write
//! (`TableStorage::stage_delete` → `commit_staged`), so delete no longer
//! advances Lance HEAD inline and the residual is gone.
//!
//! Each is named honestly at its call site; the forbidden-API guard test
//! catches direct lance::* misuse outside the storage layer.
//!
//! ## Sealed
//!
//! Both `TableStorage` and `InlineCommitResidual` are `: sealed::Sealed`.
//! Only types in this crate can implement them, so a downstream crate
//! cannot subvert the contract by providing its own impl.
//!
//! ## Opaque handles
//!
//! `SnapshotHandle` and `StagedHandle` wrap `lance::Dataset` and
//! `StagedWrite` respectively. Their inner Lance types are
//! `pub(crate)` — engine code outside `table_store` cannot reach
//! through. This aligns with the storage-boundary invariant:
//! `lance::Dataset` does not appear in trait signatures.
//!
//! ## Migration status
//!
//! Phases 1a / 2 / 4 / 5 / 6 landed in MR-793 PR #70 (trait scaffolding,
//! staged primitives, migration of `ensure_indices` / `branch_merge` /
//! `schema_apply` onto the staged surface). Phase 1b (call-site
//! conversion) and Phase 9 landed in MR-854, which also split the
//! inline-commit residuals onto `InlineCommitResidual` so `db.storage()`
//! is staged-only. Phase 7 (recovery reconciler) shipped as MR-847;
//! Phase 8 (index reconciler) is tracked as MR-848.
