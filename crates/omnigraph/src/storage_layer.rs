//! Storage trait surface — MR-793.
//!
//! `TableStorage` is the engine-internal trait that exposes the
//! staged-write primitives (`stage_append`, `stage_keyed_write`,
//! `stage_merge_insert`, `stage_overwrite`, `stage_create_indices`) plus
//! `commit_staged` as the canonical way for new engine writers to advance
//! Lance HEAD without coupling
//! "write bytes" with "advance HEAD" in one Lance API call.
//!
//! `delete_where` was the final data-write residual until MR-A: Lance 7.0's
//! `DeleteBuilder::execute_uncommitted` (#6658) made delete a staged write
//! (`TableStorage::stage_delete` → `commit_staged`), so delete no longer
//! advances Lance HEAD inline. Pinned Lance's public full-table index
//! `execute_uncommitted` shape now does the same for BTREE, FTS, and vector
//! index builds. There is no separate inline-commit storage surface left.
//!
//! The forbidden-API guard test catches direct lance::* misuse outside the
//! storage layer.
//!
//! ## Sealed
//!
//! `TableStorage` is `: sealed::Sealed`.
//! Only types in this crate can implement them, so a downstream crate
//! cannot subvert the contract by providing its own impl.
//!
//! ## Opaque handles
//!
//! `SnapshotHandle` and `StagedHandle` wrap `lance::Dataset` and
//! `StagedWrite` respectively. Their inner Lance types are
//! `pub(crate)` — engine code outside `table_store` cannot reach
//! through. This aligns with the storage-boundary invariant:
//! `lance::Dataset` does not appear in trait signatures.
//!
//! ## Migration status
//!
//! Phases 1a / 2 / 4 / 5 / 6 landed in MR-793 PR #70 (trait scaffolding,
//! staged primitives, migration of `ensure_indices` / `branch_merge` /
//! `schema_apply` onto the staged surface). Phase 1b (call-site
//! conversion) and Phase 9 landed in MR-854, which made `db.storage()`
//! staged-only. The exact EnsureIndices adapter later retired the final
//! inline-commit residual. Phase 7 (recovery reconciler) shipped as MR-847;
//! Phase 8 (index reconciler) is tracked as MR-848.
