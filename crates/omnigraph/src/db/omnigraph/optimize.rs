//! Lance compaction + version cleanup exposed at the graph level.
//!
//! Lance accumulates many small `.lance` fragment files per table over the
//! life of a graph: each `write`, `load`, and `change` op appends one or more
//! fragments and a new manifest. Over long timescales this hurts open times
//! and S3 object counts without improving anything.
//!
//! Two dials:
//!
//! * `optimize_all_tables` — Lance `compact_files` on every table. Rewrites
//!   small fragments into fewer large ones, then **publishes the compacted
//!   versions together in one `__manifest` batch** so each `table_version`
//!   tracks the compacted Lance HEAD (reads pin the manifest version, so without
//!   the publish compaction would be invisible to readers and would break the
//!   HEAD-vs-manifest precondition of schema apply / strict writes). Compaction
//!   is content-preserving (Lance `Operation::Rewrite` "reorganizes data
//!   without semantic modification"), so old fragments remain reachable via
//!   older manifest versions until `cleanup` runs.
//! * `cleanup_all_tables` — Lance `cleanup_old_versions` on every table.
//!   Removes manifests (and their unique fragments) older than the configured
//!   retention, capped at the oldest main-table version inherited by any live
//!   lazy graph branch. Destructive to unreferenced version history — callers
//!   should gate this behind an explicit confirm flag at the CLI layer.
//!
//! Both orchestrate the graph's node + edge datasets from main authority;
//! cleanup preserves both Lance-referenced native branch history and the
//! graph-level lazy-branch references Lance cannot observe.
