//! Recovery-on-open primitives.
//!
//! This module implements the building blocks of the per-sidecar recovery
//! sweep that closes the documented Phase B → Phase C residual (see
//! `docs/dev/writes.md` "Open-time recovery sweep"). The high-level shape:
//!
//! 1. Each writer that performs a multi-table commit writes a small JSON
//!    sidecar at `__recovery/{ulid}.json` BEFORE its per-table
//!    `commit_staged` loop, listing every `(table_key, table_path,
//!    expected_version, post_commit_pin)` it intends to publish.
//! 2. After the manifest publish (Phase C) succeeds, the writer deletes
//!    the sidecar.
//! 3. If the writer crashes between Phase B begin and Phase C success,
//!    the sidecar remains. The next `Omnigraph::open` (gated on
//!    `OpenMode::ReadWrite`) classifies each table in each sidecar and
//!    either rolls forward all tables (if every table is at
//!    `post_commit_pin` AND matches the sidecar) or rolls back all
//!    drifted tables to the manifest-pinned version.
//!
//! ## Verified Lance behavior the rollback path depends on
//!
//! - `Dataset::restore()` takes no version arg; restores
//!   `self.manifest.version` (currently checked-out version). From HEAD =
//!   `h`, produces a new commit at `h + 1` with content == checked-out
//!   version. Pinned by
//!   `tests/staged_writes.rs::lance_restore_appends_one_commit_with_checked_out_content`.
//! - `Dataset::restore` "wins" against concurrent Append/Update/Delete/
//!   CreateIndex/Merge — see `check_restore_txn` at lance-6.0.1
//!   `src/io/commit/conflict_resolver.rs:986`. The hazard is documented
//!   by `tests/staged_writes.rs::lance_restore_loses_to_concurrent_append_via_orphaning`.
//!   The open-time sweep sidesteps the hazard by running before any
//!   other writers can race; the in-process heal
//!   ([`heal_pending_sidecars_roll_forward`]) never restores (roll-
//!   forward only) and guards via per-(table_key, branch) queue
//!   acquisition.
