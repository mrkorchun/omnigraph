//! Internal schema versioning for the `__manifest` Lance dataset.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The on-disk shape of `__manifest` evolves alongside the engine. This module
//! is the *single* place where on-disk shape is reconciled with what the binary
//! expects:
//!
//! - One constant `INTERNAL_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` declares the shape this
//!   binary writes.
//! - One stamp `omnigraph:internal_schema_version` in the manifest dataset's
//!   schema-level metadata records the on-disk shape.
//! - One guard `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported` rejects any graph this binary
//!   cannot serve — in either direction — with a clear, actionable error.
//!
//! ## Single-version contract (strand + export/import)
//!
//! This binary reads exactly ONE internal-schema version (`MIN_SUPPORTED ==
//! CURRENT`). There is no in-place migration: a graph stamped below CURRENT is
//! refused on open with a "rebuild via `omnigraph export` + `init`/`load`"
//! message, not silently upgraded. This is the deliberate pre-release contract —
//! storage-format changes are a cutover, not a rolling in-place migration (see
//! `docs/user/operations/upgrade.md` and the versioning policy in `docs/dev`).
//! `stamp_current_version` stamps fresh graphs at CURRENT, so newly initialized
//! graphs always pass.
//!
//! ## If an in-place migration is ever needed
//!
//! The stamp + `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported` are the seam a future migration
//! would plug into: re-introduce a dispatcher that walks the stamp forward and
//! lower `MIN_SUPPORTED` below CURRENT for exactly the versions it can upgrade.
//! Until a concrete graph demands it, that machinery is unearned complexity and
//! is deliberately absent. A future converter is best shaped as a standalone
//! one-shot tool, not a framework baked into the open path.
//!
//! ## Forward-version protection
//!
//! A stamp *higher* than this binary's version triggers a clear "upgrade
//! omnigraph first" error. An old binary cannot clobber a newer schema by
//! silently treating "unknown stamp" as "missing stamp".
