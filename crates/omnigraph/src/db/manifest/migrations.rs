//! Internal schema versioning for the `__manifest` Lance dataset.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The on-disk shape of `__manifest` evolves alongside the engine. This module
//! is the *single* place where on-disk shape is reconciled with what the binary
//! expects:
//!
//! - One constant `INTERNAL_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` declares the shape this
//!   binary writes.
//! - One stamp `omnigraph:internal_schema_version` in the manifest dataset's
//!   schema-level metadata records the on-disk shape.
//! - One guard `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported` rejects any graph this binary
//!   cannot serve — in either direction — with a clear, actionable error.
//!
//! ## Single-version contract (strand + export/import)
//!
//! This binary reads exactly ONE internal-schema version (`MIN_SUPPORTED ==
//! CURRENT`). There is no in-place migration: a graph stamped below CURRENT is
//! refused on open with a "rebuild via `omnigraph export` + `init`/`load`"
//! message, not silently upgraded. This is the deliberate pre-release contract —
//! storage-format changes are a cutover, not a rolling in-place migration (see
//! `docs/user/operations/upgrade.md` and the versioning policy in `docs/dev`).
//! Fresh graphs are stamped at CURRENT *inside* the init `Dataset::write`
//! Create commit (`current_stamp_entry` rides the write's schema metadata), so
//! the stamp is atomic with manifest birth: no crash can leave `__manifest`
//! durable but unstamped.
//!
//! ## If an in-place migration is ever needed
//!
//! The stamp + `refuse_if_stamp_unsupported` are the seam a future migration
//! would plug into: re-introduce a dispatcher that walks the stamp forward and
//! lower `MIN_SUPPORTED` below CURRENT for exactly the versions it can upgrade.
//! Until a concrete graph demands it, that machinery is unearned complexity and
//! is deliberately absent. A future converter is best shaped as a standalone
//! one-shot tool, not a framework baked into the open path.
//!
//! ## Forward-version protection
//!
//! A stamp *higher* than this binary's version triggers a clear "upgrade
//! omnigraph first" error. An old binary cannot clobber a newer schema by
//! silently treating "unknown stamp" as "missing stamp".

/// - v2 — `__manifest.object_id` carries the unenforced-PK annotation,
///   engaging Lance's bloom-filter conflict resolver at commit time.
/// - v3 — one-time sweep of legacy `__run__<id>` staging branches left on the
///   `__manifest` dataset by the pre-v0.4.0 Run state machine.
/// - v4 — RFC-013 Phase 7 folds graph lineage into `__manifest` as
///   `graph_commit`/`graph_head` rows written in the publish CAS (no
///   `_graph_commits.lance`).
/// - v5 — RFC-028 adds non-zero stable-table/incarnation identity columns;
///   table registration, version, tombstone, fold, OCC, and physical paths are
///   keyed by that immutable identity rather than the mutable table alias.
/// - v6 — RFC-023 makes every node/edge physical table keyed by exactly its
///   non-null `id` field using Lance's unenforced-primary-key metadata. The
///   annotation is present at dataset creation and preserved by overwrites;
///   older graphs cross this immutable boundary by export/init/load rebuild.
