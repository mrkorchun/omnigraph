//! Per-`(table_key, branch)` writer queues.
//!
//! These queues are the engine's write-serialization mechanism: the server
//! holds the engine as a lockless `Arc<Omnigraph>` (writes are `&self`), so
//! disjoint-key writes proceed concurrently and only writes to the same
//! `(table_key, branch_ref)` serialize here. This module owns the queue
//! data structure; callers in `MutationStaging::commit_all`, `branch_merge`,
//! `schema_apply`, `ensure_indices`, the fork path (first write to a table on
//! a branch — acquired before the fork, held through the manifest publish),
//! and the recovery reconciler acquire guards before any per-table Lance
//! commit. Serialization is in-process only; cross-process
//! writers on one graph remain one-winner-CAS at the manifest publish.
//!
//! ## Why exclusive `tokio::sync::Mutex<()>` per key
//!
//! Lance's `Dataset::restore` "wins" against concurrent Append/Update/
//! Delete/CreateIndex/Merge per `check_restore_txn`, silently orphaning
//! the concurrent writer's commit. The queue's *only* application-layer
//! job is to serialize Restore against every other writer on the same
//! `(table_key, branch_ref)`. Lance OCC handles the rest of the conflict
//! matrix (Append vs Append fully compatible, Update vs Update rebases or
//! retries, etc.) but cannot make Restore symmetric — that's an upstream
//! design choice. Until Lance fixes Restore (or BatchCommitTables
//! changes the protocol), every writer takes the same exclusive lock.
//!
//! `RwLock` (shared for normal writes, exclusive for Restore) is the
//! natural follow-up but adds a writer-classification surface that's
//! easy to get wrong; misclassifying any writer reintroduces the
//! orphaning hazard. We start with `Mutex` and revisit based on
//! production telemetry.
//!
//! ## Sorted-order acquisition
//!
//! `acquire_many` accepts a slice of keys and acquires them in
//! lexicographic order. Multi-table writers (mutation finalize,
//! branch_merge, future recovery reconciler) MUST go through
//! `acquire_many` so all callers agree on acquisition order — this is
//! how lock-order inversion deadlock is prevented.
