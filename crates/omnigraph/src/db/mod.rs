///   check. Lance's `MergeInsertBuilder` rebases concurrent appends; the
///   per-(table, branch) writer queue serializes `commit_staged`; the
///   publisher's CAS (refreshed under the queue via
///   `MutationStaging::commit_all`'s `snapshot_for_branch` call) catches
///   genuine cross-process drift as `ManifestConflictDetails::ExpectedVersionMismatch`.
///   The pre-stage strict check would over-reject in-process concurrent
///   inserts, which is exactly the case PR 2 / MR-686 designed the
///   per-table queue to allow.
///
/// - `Update` / `Delete`: keep the strict check. These have read-modify-write
///   semantics; Lance moving between the read at stage time and the write
///   at commit time means the staged batch is computed against stale state.
///   The strict check guards the per-query SI invariant. SERIALIZABLE
///   opt-in (§VI.36 future seam) is the long-term answer for tighter
///   semantics; today, in-process update-update races on the same key
///   stay rejected as 409 — acceptable.
///
/// - `SchemaRewrite`: keep the strict check. Schema apply runs under the
///   graph-wide `__schema_apply_lock__` AND per-table queues; the strict
///   check is uncontested at that point.
