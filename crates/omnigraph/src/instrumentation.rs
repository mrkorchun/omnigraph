//! Read-path cost instrumentation (test seam).
//!
//! Two boundary instruments let cost-budget tests assert that a warm read does
//! no redundant IO, the way LanceDB's IO-counted tests do (see
//! `docs/dev/testing.md`, "Cost-budget tests"):
//!
//! - **Lance object store** — a per-query [`WrappingObjectStore`] attached to the
//!   datasets a query opens, so a test counts real `read_iops`. Delivered through
//!   a task-local ([`QueryIoProbes`]) set by the test; production leaves it unset,
//!   so the open helpers attach nothing (one unset-`Option` check per open).
//! - **omnigraph `StorageAdapter`** — [`CountingStorageAdapter`], a decorator that
//!   counts per-method calls (the schema-contract reads on the query path).
//!
//! The probes themselves only observe, and the decorator delegates every call.
//! The shared dataset opener also supplies the process control session when a
//! caller has no graph-scoped data session, so detached opens still reuse the
//! process object-store registry without caching mutable metadata. `IOTracker`
//! (the concrete counter) lives in tests via the `lance-io` dev-dependency; this
//! module stays generic over the `lance::io`-re-exported trait, so it adds no
//! production dependency.
