//! Per-query staging accumulator for direct-publish writes.
//!
//! `MutationStaging` accumulates per-table input batches in memory during a
//! `mutate_as` or `load` query, then at end-of-query commits each touched
//! table via Lance's distributed-write API (one `stage_*` + `commit_staged`
//! per table) and returns the publisher inputs (`SubTableUpdate` list +
//! `expected_table_versions`).
//!
//! Read-your-writes within the same query is satisfied by the in-memory
//! pending batches (see `pending_batches`) — read sites union the committed
//! Lance scan with the pending Arrow batches via DataFusion `MemTable` (see
//! `crate::table_store::TableStore::scan_with_pending`).
//!
//! This module is shared by the engine's mutation path (`exec/mutation.rs`)
//! and the bulk loader (`loader/mod.rs`); both feed insert/update batches
//! into `pending` and route end-of-query commits through `finalize`.
//! Deletes accumulate as predicates in `delete_predicates` (via
//! `record_delete`) and stage through the same `stage_* → commit_staged`
//! path as writes — `stage_delete` produces a deletion-vector transaction
//! that advances no Lance HEAD until the end-of-query commit. The parse-time
//! D₂ rule keeps inserts/updates and deletes from mixing in one query, so
//! `pending` and `delete_predicates` never overlap on a table.
