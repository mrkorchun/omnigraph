//! Per-query staging accumulator for direct-publish writes.
//!
//! `MutationStaging` accumulates per-table input batches in memory during a
//! `mutate_as` or `load` query. At end-of-query it prepares one staged Lance
//! transaction per touched existing ref (or a deferred first-touch plan), then
//! joins the RFC-022 protocol: acquire ordered gates, revalidate the complete
//! read set, arm durable recovery, apply the physical effects, and return the
//! exact publisher inputs while retaining the guards through manifest CAS.
//!
//! Read-your-writes within the same query is satisfied by the in-memory
//! pending batches (see `pending_batches`) — read sites union the committed
//! Lance scan with the pending Arrow batches via DataFusion `MemTable` (see
//! `crate::table_store::TableStore::scan_with_pending`).
//!
//! This module is shared by the engine's mutation path (`exec/mutation.rs`)
//! and the bulk loader (`loader/mod.rs`); both feed insert/update batches
//! into `pending` and route end-of-query work through `stage_all` then
//! `commit_all`, followed by one exact manifest publish.
//! Deletes accumulate as predicates in `delete_predicates` (via
//! `record_delete`) and stage through the same `stage_* → commit_staged`
//! path as writes — `stage_delete` produces a deletion-vector transaction
//! that advances no Lance HEAD until the end-of-query commit. The parse-time
//! D₂ rule keeps inserts/updates and deletes from mixing in one query, so
//! `pending` and `delete_predicates` never overlap on a table.
