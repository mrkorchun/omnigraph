# HTTP Server (`omnigraph-server`)

Axum 0.8 + tokio + utoipa-generated OpenAPI. **Cluster-only boot**: the server always boots from a cluster (`--cluster <dir | s3://…>`) and serves N graphs (N ≥ 1) under cluster routes. There is no longer a single-graph flat-route mode, no positional `<URI>` boot, no `--target`, and no `omnigraph.yaml`-`graphs:`-map boot. All HTTP is nested under `/graphs/{graph_id}/...`; `/healthz` and the management `/graphs` enumeration stay flat.

## Boot

### Cluster boot (the only boot)

```bash
omnigraph-server --cluster <dir | s3://…> --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```

`omnigraph-server --cluster <dir-or-uri>` boots from the cluster catalog's
**applied revision**. The server resolves that revision into per-graph
startup configs (id, URI, optional per-graph policy, stored-query
registry) plus an optional server-level policy, then opens every
configured graph in parallel at startup (bounded concurrency = 4,
quarantining graph-specific open failures). Routing is always multi-graph —
requests to bare flat protected paths (`/read`, `/snapshot`, …) return
404; the served surface is `/graphs/{graph_id}/...`. See
[cluster-config.md](../clusters/config.md#serving-from-the-cluster-the-mode-switch)
for what is read and the readiness rules.

Readiness is fail-fast for cluster-global problems: missing or unreadable
state, invalid/unattributable recovery sidecars, unreadable shared catalog
payloads, cluster policy errors, or zero healthy graphs. Graph-attributed
pending recovery sidecars and graph-specific startup failures quarantine
that graph instead; the server logs startup diagnostics and serves the
remaining healthy graphs. `GET /graphs` enumerates ready/served graphs only,
so quarantined graphs are absent and their routes return 404.

Operators who want the original all-or-nothing boot contract can pass
`--require-all-graphs` or set `OMNIGRAPH_REQUIRE_ALL_GRAPHS=1`. In that mode,
any graph quarantine, graph-open failure, stored-query startup failure, or
embedding-provider resolution failure aborts startup.

A scheme-qualified argument (`s3://…`) reads the ledger straight from the
storage root, with no local config directory. `--bind`,
`--unauthenticated`, and the bearer-token env vars all apply.

### Stored-query validation at startup

If a graph declares a `queries:` registry (see [cli-reference](../cli/reference.md)), the server **loads and type-checks every stored query against that graph's live schema at startup**. Query parse/type failures quarantine that graph; if no graph remains healthy, startup refuses. Two MCP-exposed queries claiming the same tool name are likewise graph-local startup failures. Non-blocking advisories (e.g. an MCP-exposed query with a vector parameter an agent cannot supply) are logged. Validate offline before deploying with `omnigraph queries validate`. Discover the stored queries as a typed tool catalog with `GET /queries`, and invoke one over HTTP with `POST /queries/{name}` (both below).

## Endpoint inventory

Per-graph endpoints — all nested under `/graphs/{id}/...`. `{id}` is the
graph id from the cluster's applied revision:

| Method | Path | Auth | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/healthz` | none | — |
| GET | `/openapi.json` | none | — (strips security if auth disabled; emits the nested cluster paths with `cluster_` operation-id prefix) |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/snapshot?branch=` | bearer + `read` | snapshot of branch |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/query` | bearer + `read` | inline read query (canonical; clean field names `query`/`name`; mutations → 400) |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/read` | bearer + `read` | **deprecated** alias of `/query` (legacy field names `query_source`/`query_name`, byte-stable response; carries `Deprecation: true` + `Link: <query>; rel="successor-version"`) |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/export` | bearer + `export` | NDJSON stream |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/mutate` | bearer + `change` | mutation (canonical; `query`/`name`; accepts legacy `query_source`/`query_name` as serde aliases) |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/change` | bearer + `change` | **deprecated** alias of `/mutate` (carries `Deprecation: true` + `Link: <mutate>; rel="successor-version"`) |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/queries` | bearer + `read` | list the graph's stored queries as a typed tool catalog |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/queries/{name}` | bearer + `invoke_query` (+ `change` for a stored mutation) | invoke a named query from the `queries:` registry; deny == 404 |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/schema` | bearer + `read` | get current `.pg` source |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/schema/apply` | bearer + `schema_apply` (target=`main`) | disabled for cluster-backed serving; returns 409 and points operators at `omnigraph cluster apply` + restart |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/load` | bearer + `branch_create` (only when `from` is set and the branch is created) + `change` | bulk load (canonical); branch creation is opt-in via `from` — without it a missing `branch` is a 404, never an implicit fork (32 MB body limit) |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/ingest` | bearer + `branch_create` (only when `from` is set and the branch is created) + `change` | **deprecated** alias of `/load` (carries `Deprecation: true` + `Link: <load>; rel="successor-version"`) (32 MB body limit) |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/branches` | bearer + `read` | list branches |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/branches` | bearer + `branch_create` | create |
| DELETE | `/graphs/{id}/branches/{branch}` | bearer + `branch_delete` | delete |
| POST | `/graphs/{id}/branches/merge` | bearer + `branch_merge` | merge `source → target` |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/commits?branch=` | bearer + `read` | list |
| GET | `/graphs/{id}/commits/{commit_id}` | bearer + `read` | show |

Server-level management endpoints:

| Method | Path | Auth | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/graphs` | bearer + `graph_list` on `Server::"root"` | list ready/served graphs |

> The per-graph subsections below name routes in shorthand (`GET /queries`,
> `POST /query`, `POST /mutate`, `POST /queries/{name}`); every one is served
> under the `/graphs/{id}/…` prefix shown in the table — only `/graphs` and
> `/healthz` are flat.

### Stored-query catalog (`GET /queries`)

List the graph's stored queries as a typed tool catalog — enough for a client (e.g. an MCP server) to register each as a tool without fetching `.gq` source. Each entry: `{ name, tool_name, description, instruction, mutation, params }`, where each param is `{ name, kind, item_kind?, vector_dim?, nullable }`. `kind` is one of `string | bool | int | bigint | float | date | datetime | blob | vector | list` (decomposed so a consumer maps it with a closed `switch`, never re-parsing GQ type spelling). `bigint` (I64/U64), `date`, `datetime`, and `blob` are carried as JSON **strings** — a 64-bit integer loses precision as a JSON number, dates are ISO strings, and a blob is a URI string.

- **Read-gated** (works in default-deny mode). The catalog is **graph-wide** (branch-independent; `read` is authorized against `main`).
- **Every stored query in the applied registry is listed.** Cluster-served graphs have no per-query expose flag today — every query in the cluster `queries:` registry appears in the catalog. (Per-query exposure may become a Cedar-policy decision in a later release; see [cluster-config](../clusters/config.md).)
- **Not Cedar-filtered per query (yet).** A caller with `read` but not `invoke_query` can *list* a query they can't *invoke* (which would 404). Closing that gap is future per-query authorization; for now the catalog is a discovery surface and `invoke_query` remains the invocation gate.

### Stored-query invocation (`POST /queries/{name}`)

Invoke a curated, server-side stored query by **name** — the source comes from the graph's `queries:` registry, so the client never sends `.gq`. The request body itself is optional; omit it for no-param queries, or send `{ "params": { … }, "branch": "main", "snapshot": null }`, where every field is optional and `params` keys match the query's declared parameters. The response is the **read envelope** (`ReadOutput`) for a stored read or the **mutation envelope** (`ChangeOutput`) for a stored mutation — serialized untagged, so the wire shape is identical to `/query` / `/mutate`.

- **Gate:** `invoke_query` (per-graph, graph-scoped) at the boundary. A stored *mutation* is **double-gated** — it also passes the engine's `change` gate, so an actor with `invoke_query` but not `change` gets `403`.
- **Deny == unknown, for callers without `invoke_query`:** for a caller lacking the grant, an `invoke_query` denial and an unknown query name return the **same `404`** (identical body), so the catalog can't be probed. A caller that *holds* `invoke_query` may still get the inner gate's `403` for an existing query it can't `read`/`change` (the double-gate, above) — so existence is visible to grant-holders by design.
- **Requires an explicit policy grant when auth is on.** In default-deny mode (bearer tokens but no `policy.file`), only `read` is permitted, so *every* `/queries/{name}` call returns `404` until an `invoke_query` rule is configured.
- A stored mutation cannot target a `snapshot` (`400`); a parameter type error is a structured `400` naming the parameter.

## Adding and removing graphs

Runtime add/remove via API is **not** exposed — neither `POST /graphs`
nor `DELETE /graphs/{id}` is implemented. Operators add or remove graphs
by running `cluster apply` against the cluster (which publishes a new
applied revision) and restarting the server so it boots from the new
revision. The server treats the cluster source as operator-owned and
never writes it.

A future release may introduce a managed registry and re-expose runtime
mutation on top of it.

## Inline read queries (`POST /query`)

`POST /query` is the read-only, agent-friendly twin of `POST /read`. The
request body uses clean field names that match the CLI `-e` flag and the GQ
`query` keyword:

```json
{
  "query":    "query find($n: String) { match { $p: Person { name: $n } } return { $p.name } }",
  "name":     "find",
  "params":   { "n": "Alice" },
  "branch":   "main",
  "snapshot": null
}
```

Response shape is identical to `/read` (`ReadOutput`). If the inline source
contains mutations (`insert` / `update` / `delete`), the request is rejected
with HTTP 400 and an error pointing the caller at `POST /mutate` — the
read-only contract is enforced at the URL.

`POST /mutate` is the canonical mutation endpoint. It accepts the same clean
field names (`query`, `name`); the legacy field names `query_source` and
`query_name` continue to deserialize as serde aliases so existing clients keep
working without changes.

## Deprecated names (`/read`, `/change`)

`POST /read` and `POST /change` are kept for back-compat indefinitely — they
are byte-stable on the request side and otherwise behave identically to
`/query` / `/mutate`. They are flagged as deprecated through three independent
channels:

- **OpenAPI**: the operations carry `deprecated: true` in `openapi.json`, so
  every OpenAPI codegen (typescript-fetch, openapi-generator, oapi-codegen,
  …) emits a `@deprecated` marker on the generated SDK method.
- **Response headers (RFC 9745)**: every response carries `Deprecation: true`.
- **Response headers (RFC 8288)**: every response carries a `Link` header
  pointing at the canonical successor:
  `Link: <query>; rel="successor-version"` for `/read`, and
  `Link: <mutate>; rel="successor-version"` for `/change`. SDKs and HTTP
  proxies can pick the successor up automatically.

Migration is purely cosmetic on the client side — swap the URL path, leave
the request body and response handling alone.

## Streaming

Only `/export` streams (`application/x-ndjson`, MPSC channel + `Body::from_stream`). Everything else is buffered JSON.

## Error model

Uniform `ErrorOutput { error, code?, merge_conflicts[], manifest_conflict? }` with `code ∈ unauthorized | forbidden | bad_request | not_found | conflict | too_many_requests | internal`. Merge conflicts attach structured `MergeConflictOutput { table_key, row_id?, kind, message }`.

`manifest_conflict` is set on **concurrent-write rejections** (HTTP 409): the
caller's pre-write view of one table's manifest version was stale.
`ManifestConflictOutput { table_key, expected, actual }` tells the client
which table to refresh and retry. This is the conflict shape produced by
concurrent `/mutate` (or its `/change` alias), `/load` (or its deprecated
`/ingest` alias) calls landing the same `(table, branch)` race.

HTTP status codes used: 200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 429, 500.

## Per-actor admission control

Disjoint
`(table, branch)` writes from different actors now run concurrently,
guarded only by the engine's per-(table, branch) write queue. To keep
one heavy actor from exhausting shared capacity (Lance I/O, manifest
churn, network), the server gates mutating handlers through per-process
admission limits configured from environment variables:

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OMNIGRAPH_PER_ACTOR_INFLIGHT_MAX` | 16 | Concurrent in-flight mutations per actor |
| `OMNIGRAPH_PER_ACTOR_BYTES_MAX` | 4 GiB | In-flight estimated bytes per actor |

When an actor exceeds its in-flight count or byte budget, the server
returns **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** with `code: too_many_requests`
and a `Retry-After` header (seconds). The actor should back off; other
actors are unaffected.

Cedar policy authorization runs **before** admission accounting so
denied requests don't consume admission slots.

Today admission gates every mutating handler: `/mutate` (and its
deprecated alias `/change`), `/load` (and its deprecated alias `/ingest`),
`/branches/{create,delete,merge}`,
and `/schema/apply`. Read-only endpoints (`/snapshot`, `/query`, `/read`,
`/export`, `/branches` GET, `/commits`, `/schema` GET) are not
admission-gated.

## Body limits

- Default: 1 MB
- `/load` (and its deprecated `/ingest` alias): 32 MB

## Auth model (`bearer + SHA-256`)

- Tokens are SHA-256 hashed on startup; plaintext is never persisted in memory.
- Constant-time comparison.
- Three sources, in precedence:
  1. `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_AWS_SECRET` — AWS Secrets Manager (build with `--features aws`)
  2. `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_FILE` or `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKENS_JSON` — JSON `{actor_id: token, …}`
  3. `OMNIGRAPH_SERVER_BEARER_TOKEN` — single legacy token, actor `default`
- If no tokens are configured, startup refuses unless `--unauthenticated` or
  `OMNIGRAPH_UNAUTHENTICATED=1` explicitly opts into open local-dev mode. A
  policy file without tokens is also rejected at startup. In open mode
  `/openapi.json` strips the security scheme.

See [deployment.md](../deployment.md) for token-source operational details.

## Tracing & observability

- `tower_http::TraceLayer::new_for_http()`
- Policy decisions logged at INFO level with actor, action, branch, decision, matched rule
- Startup logs: token source name, graph URI, bind address
- Graceful SIGINT shutdown

## Not implemented (by design or "TBD")

- CORS — not configured; add `tower_http::cors` if needed.
- Rate limiting — per-actor admission control gates `/mutate` (alias
  `/change`), `/load` (alias `/ingest`), `/branches/{create,delete,merge}`,
  `/schema/apply` (see "Per-actor
  admission control" above). No global rate limiter is configured;
  add `tower_http::limit` if a graph-wide cap is needed.
- Pagination — none (commits/branches return everything; export streams).
- Runtime graph add/remove — run `cluster apply` and restart.
