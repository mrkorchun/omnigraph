# Mutations

Write statements live inside a `query` declaration whose body is one or more
mutation statements (the [query language](../queries/index.md) covers the read
shape and shared declaration syntax).

```
query onboard($name: String, $title: String) {
  insert Person { name: $name, title: $title }
}
```

An edge type is inserted the same way — its endpoint columns are just
properties in the assignment block (`insert WorksAt { person: $p, org: $o }`).

## Statements

- `insert <Type> { prop: <value>, … }`
- `update <Type> set { prop: <value>, … } where <prop> <op> <value>`
- `delete <Type> where <prop> <op> <value>`

`<value>` is a literal, `$param`, or `now()`.

On a blob-bearing type, an update materializes and rewrites blob payloads only
for the rows matched by its predicate, including blobs the update does not
change. This keeps correctness independent of physical index state, but adds
read/write I/O proportional to the matched blob bytes; use selective update
predicates for large blobs.

## Atomicity

A change query publishes **one commit** at the end of the query. Multiple
insert/update statements accumulate in memory and commit together — a mid-query
failure leaves the graph untouched. See [transactions](../branching/transactions.md)
for the per-query atomicity contract and [branches](../branching/index.md) for
multi-query workflows.

Concurrent changes use optimistic concurrency over the whole target branch.
Retryable insert/upsert/load operations whose branch authority changed before
physical effects may be discarded and fully revalidated with a bounded
internal retry. A load in `append` mode remains strict insert through such a
retry; it never changes mode. Strict Update/Delete/Overwrite operations instead
return a structured read-set conflict. This branch-wide token is deliberately
conservative: a change to a different table can invalidate a prepared strict
write because constraints may have read it.

Every node and edge table is keyed physically by `id`. The storage transaction
for an insertion or upsert carries an exact-`id` conflict filter:

- a keyed node `insert` is an upsert by its derived `id`;
- generated-ID node and edge inserts are strict inserts;
- `load --mode append` is strict insert: an existing `id` returns structured
  `key_conflict` and the existing row is unchanged;
- `load --mode merge` is upsert: an existing `id` is updated.

For a node with `@key`, the derived `id` represents the complete typed key
tuple, not only its first property. Single-column keys use the canonical scalar
spelling; composite keys use a JSON array of canonical scalar strings in stable
property-identity order. The same renderer is shared by mutation and load, and
every member of a composite key is immutable during an update. See the
[schema language](../schema/index.md#table-layout) for the exact scalar rules.

A concurrent same-key conflict has effect-aware handling. If no table effect
from the attempt landed, strict insert is rechecked against fresh
manifest-visible state and returns terminal `key_conflict` only when one of its
attempted IDs now exists. A generic storage conflict with no exact match is
never mislabeled as a duplicate: the engine discards the whole strict attempt
and performs a bounded reprepare without changing it to upsert. Upsert likewise
discards the whole attempt and reruns preparation and validation. If an earlier
table already advanced, or the engine cannot prove the attempt effect-free, it
returns `recovery_required` and retains the recovery intent. No partial attempt
is retried around unresolved state.

Keyed mutation and load tables use one storage transaction per graph commit.
Each table's accumulated strict-insert or upsert input is limited to 8,192 rows
and 32 MiB of staged Arrow memory. An update also streams its predicate matches
against the table's remaining budget after pending rows are counted and
same-query pending IDs shadow committed rows; stored Blob size is checked before
its payload is read. Exceeding either limit returns HTTP **413** with structured
`resource_limit` details before the recovery intent is armed, with no durable
effect. Submit a larger incremental load as explicit chunks—
each chunk is a separate atomic graph commit. `--mode overwrite` escapes the
keyed row ceiling (a whole-table replacement is not row-capped), but **not**
the strict-input Arrow preflight: every strict load mode, Overwrite included,
refuses a batch whose projected Arrow allocation exceeds 32 MiB with typed
`strict_input_arrow_bytes` before any durable effect. A bulk replacement
larger than that is loaded as one `--mode overwrite` chunk followed by
`--mode merge` chunks.

Blob values supplied as external URIs must first pass the graph's immutable
external-Blob policy; new URI ingress is denied by default. Keyed insert/upsert
and load `append`/`merge` then sum the declared ranges or object sizes before
reading payload bytes, reject an aggregate above 32 MiB, and copy accepted bytes
into the staged blob. Load `overwrite` keeps the accepted external URI cell as a
reference. This distinction exists because Lance's merge-insert builder cannot
accept the `WriteParams` option used by Overwrite. Direct-store CLI execution is
deny-only in this phase; use a configured cluster server or the embedded builder
to supply graph-level allow bases.

If the synchronous barrier finds an unresolved overlapping recovery intent, or
if a conflict is discovered after a Lance table effect is durable, the request
returns `recovery_required` with an operation id. Do not immediately retry that
request; reopen the graph read-write (or restart the server) so the durable
recovery intent is resolved first.

## Conditional writes (`Omnigraph-If-Graph-Commit` / `--if-commit`)

A mutation can carry a caller compare-and-swap precondition on the branch
head: run only if nothing has committed to the branch since the caller read
it. This turns read-then-write flows (claim a task, take a work item, edit
what you last saw) into a single-round-trip atomic operation across concurrent
requests served by OmniGraph's one supported live writer process — a lost race
is rejected by the store instead of silently overwriting the write that got
there first.

1. Read the data your decision depends on. For the CLI, use `omnigraph query
   ... --json`; the JSON response carries `graph_commit_id` — the head commit
   id of the exact snapshot your rows were served from. Default table, KV, and
   CSV renderings intentionally show rows rather than envelope metadata.
2. Send the mutation with that id as the precondition: `omnigraph mutate
   <name> ... --if-commit <id>`, or the
   `Omnigraph-If-Graph-Commit: <id>` header on the dedicated
   `POST /mutate/if-graph-commit` route or
   `POST /queries/{name}/if-graph-commit` for a stored mutation. The ordinary
   routes reject this header.
3. Branch head still `<id>` at the pre-effect arbitration point → the mutation
   runs and commits; inside the supported topology, success proves no other
   write interleaved. Head moved → HTTP **412** with
   structured `precondition_failure { expected, actual }` (CLI: exit code 4)
   and **zero effect** — re-read the branch and decide again.

The precondition is branch-scoped: **any** commit to the branch invalidates
an outstanding id, including writes to unrelated rows or tables. A 412 does
not necessarily mean the rows you care about changed — it means *something*
did, and your knowledge can no longer be proven current. Under concurrent
writers this produces occasional rejections between operations that do not
truly conflict; the re-read-and-retry loop is the intended handling, and its
cost grows with the branch's total write rate.

Use the id from the read response, not one fetched separately. The response's
`graph_commit_id` comes from the same pinned version as the rows, so it
certifies exactly the world you observed. If you must obtain the id some
other way (`omnigraph commit list` / `GET /commits`), fetch it **before**
the read: an id fetched before is conservative (any commit between fetch and
read moves the head, and the write correctly fails), while an id fetched
*after* the read certifies nothing — it can postdate the very commit that
invalidated what you read, and the precondition then passes against a
premise that is already false.

The check is evaluated against the same pinned view the write executes against
and is re-evaluated under the process-wide branch gate immediately before any
effect (or before acknowledging a no-op). A failed precondition is terminal: it
is never internally retried
(unlike the bounded reprepare that [Atomicity](#atomicity) describes for
insert-only operations), because the rejection is precisely the information
the caller requested. The `*` and weak (`W/"..."`) entity-tag forms are
rejected.

The distinct HTTP path is the rolling-upgrade capability check. A newer CLI
never sends a conditional write to an older server's ordinary mutation route:
an older server does not have the dedicated route and returns 404 before a
mutation handler runs, instead of ignoring an unknown optional header and
writing unconditionally.

This does not expand OmniGraph's documented write topology. The branch gate is
process-local and destructive recovery is currently supported only with one
live writer process. A foreign writer in the unsupported distributed topology
can still win after the local pre-effect check; the exact publisher prevents a
silent lost update, but because table effects may already be durable the loser
returns `recovery_required` (HTTP 503), not 412. Do not deploy multiple writer
processes as a way to obtain distributed CAS until the distributed fence in
the recovery roadmap exists.

## Inserts/updates and deletes cannot mix in one query

A single change query must be **either insert/update-only or delete-only**.
Mixing the two is rejected at parse time, before any I/O:

> `mutation '<name>' on the same query mixes inserts/updates and deletes; split
> into separate mutations: (1) inserts and updates, then (2) deletes.`

Run two separate queries instead — the inserts/updates first, then the deletes.
Each query is still atomic on its own. This is a deliberate rule: inserts,
updates, and deletes all stage and commit through the same path, but keeping a
single query to one kind means its read-your-writes stays unambiguous (a read
within the query never has to reconcile rows you inserted against rows you
deleted in the same query). If you need the inserts/updates and deletes to land
as **one** atomic commit, run them on a branch and merge it.

## Bulk loading

For loading data from files rather than inline statements, use
[`omnigraph load`](../cli/index.md) (`--mode overwrite|append|merge`) — it is the
single bulk-write command and applies the same schema validation and atomic
publish as inline mutations. `append` means strict insert, `merge` means upsert,
and `overwrite` replaces the target image; these are logical semantics, not
names of raw Lance operations.

The file is strict graph-level NDJSON: each nonblank line is one
`{"type":"<Node>","data":{...}}` or
`{"edge":"<Edge>","from":"<src-id>","to":"<dst-id>","data":{...}}`
envelope. `data` defaults to `{}`, and one file may mix declarations without
exposing any table or dataset selector. Local and remote `load` use the same
parser and one graph transaction; see [the CLI guide](../cli/index.md) and the
[raw HTTP route](../operations/server.md#bounded-graph-batch-ingestion).
`omnigraph ingest` remains only as a deprecated loader-compatible command for
older integrations; it is not the strict `load` grammar.
