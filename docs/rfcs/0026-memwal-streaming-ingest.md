# RFC-026 — MemWAL streaming ingest

**Status:** Rejected (2026-08-06). The implementation and its unreleased
manifest v7-v19 formats were removed. See
[Streaming ingestion after RFC-026](../dev/wal-removal.md).

The experiment proved that Lance MemWAL can durably accept per-dataset rows,
but OmniGraph still needed separate graph-level validation, token authority,
fold, correction, lifecycle, and cross-dataset publication machinery. That
coordination dominated throughput and produced a durability-before-visibility
contract the product did not need. Current high-rate ingestion is a bounded
graph-level facade over the ordinary commit-visible `load_as` transaction.

The remainder of this RFC is retained unchanged as historical design and
implementation evidence. It is not an active contract.
**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Gate E0 evaluated:** 2026-07-18
**Phase A foundation completed:** 2026-07-18
**Historical Phase B1 subset acceptance:** 2026-07-19 (internal schema v8,
stream-config v2, recovery-v11, one feature-gated engine seam, and the then-
declared §12.3 shape set passed; Gate R0 later superseded the blanket all-shape
claim)
**Phase B1 acknowledgement-fence containment:** 2026-07-20 (after watcher
success, private B1 requires the same `ShardWriter` to pass
`check_fenced()` before a clean acknowledgement; fence loss or an unreadable
or unsettled check is `AckUnknown` plus worker retirement)
**Phase B1 near-cap closure repaired:** 2026-07-21 (fresh scanner batches are
densified before retention; the legal high-entropy 32-MiB logical generation now folds
and publishes exactly once; see §0.2 and §12.3)
**Phase B2 contract inventory:** 2026-07-19 (§4.1–§4.6 specified the common
admission/token, attribution, revision-fenced lifecycle, correction, retention,
and graph-global closure-budget contracts; the 2026-07-21 amendment removes
physical-storage quotas, aggregate receipt caps, and `GraphHistoryBudget` from
the selected retain-all profile; it activates no schema or product surface)
**Gate R0 evaluated:** 2026-07-20 — historical **no-go** for a *bounded*
retain-all profile on stock RC.1; its storage findings are accepted limitations
of the selected unbounded profile and its fold blocker is now closed (§0.2)
**Retention decision:** 2026-07-21 — select unbounded retain-all/no-GC for the
first profile; managed reclamation remains deferred (§4.5)
**Private Phase B2a gate completed:** 2026-07-21 — structural no-reclamation
guard, complete/partial provider-residue recovery matrix, and local/configured-
RustFS retained-history evidence passed (§12.5); no schema or product surface
was activated
**Private Phase B2 token/fold core completed:** 2026-07-22 — internal schema
v9, stream-config v3, lifecycle state-v2, manifest-selected graph-global
`_stream_tokens.lance`, canonical payload/token digests, post-admission
authority recapture, recovery-v12 exact base+token fold, durable graph-commit
attribution, and the genuine v8↔v9 refusal/rebuild gate passed (§11/§12.6);
at that checkpoint explicit production enrollment, lifecycle management,
correction/status, and all product surfaces remained inactive (the
authorization/status slice below changed that boundary on 2026-07-28)
**Experimental activation profile selected:** 2026-07-27 — cluster-only,
manifest-propagated enablement, lazy graph-wide enrollment, caller-supplied
vectors, terminal per-key object-form dead letter plus recovery-bound
structural-authority correction, no read-your-writes bridge, starvation-free
serial dependency-prioritized fold core with non-overlapping resident-enabled
and offline-disable owners, upsert-only (§4.7)
**§4.7 P1 enablement authority implemented:** 2026-07-28 — internal schema
v10 (required genesis `stream_profile` singleton + now-frozen explicit-null
fold-attribution dead-letter compatibility placeholder), the Cedar-gated
single-CAS `set_streaming_enabled_as`
flip, intended cluster-apply-only propagation with refresh convergence and typed
pending-until-drained refusal, and the historical v9-source → CURRENT
refusal/rebuild coverage. Its ambient public method is a known pre-activation gap; F2 replaces it
with the capability-bound cluster-control adapter and durable automatic-fold
delegation selected below. P2's product/transport surface and P3–P7 remain
unimplemented; no ingest surface is active
**Private P2 prepare proof implemented:** 2026-07-31 — a feature-gated,
bodyless engine seam now proves effect-free witness challenge, lazy recovery-v14
enrollment, durable actor/intent replay, and concurrent one-lane convergence.
It exposes no production SDK, CLI, HTTP, or OpenAPI surface and fails closed
unless the current binding is still the initial binding; F3 owns full
binding-chain ancestry when rebind activates.
**Streaming authorization split and read-only status implemented:**
2026-07-28 — the `stream_ingest` / `stream_manage` Cedar actions of §4.6 are
registered (both graph-scoped; the main-only profile makes a branch dimension
meaningless, so both scope qualifiers are rejected at validation), the P1
enablement flip migrated from the reserved `Admin` action onto
`stream_manage`, and `Omnigraph::stream_status` projects the durable
enablement and per-lane authority read-only. Status deliberately ships before
the management verbs because §4.6 makes it the compare-token source: it
exposes the `lifecycle_revision` those verbs pass back as their expected
revision, so they can be written as compare-and-set from the start. This is
the §4.7 *minimal* status — the authoritative manifest row only; §4.3's
exclusive-cut physical observation (observed epoch, pending generation
rows/bytes, `StatusChanged`/`StatusBusy`) arrives with the verbs that need
it, as an additive observed-physical section. F6b6 later implemented that
checked observation core internally without changing this public projection
or adding a transport.
**F2 entry scaffold implemented:** 2026-07-29 — `omnigraph-storage` now owns
the one local/S3 control-object implementation and
`omnigraph-control-authority` owns the unchanged persisted cluster lock below
the engine/cluster split; the nine-crate DAG and crates.io publish order
compile without a cycle. This checkpoint also experimented with shadow
attested/keyed firehose CI jobs; the 2026-07-30 scope refactor removed that
unused pipeline after its cold path proved unsustainable and its shadow path
provided no test evidence. The ordinary lightweight PR checks remain, authors
record focused local validation, and the full workspace/format/RustFS suites
run post-merge or manually with a red-main stop-the-line policy. No incomplete
checked capability constructor was exposed at this checkpoint and no
format/authority behavior was activated.
**Bounded F2 profile-authority tranche implemented:** 2026-07-29 — internal
schema v11 replaces the v10 boolean profile with protocol-v2 `DISABLED`,
delegated `ENABLED`, explicit/resumable `DISABLING`, and fail-closed `RETIRED`
states. Opaque stopped/offline apply and served-runtime guards bind canonical
cluster state, declaration/profile revisions, actor, and runtime lifetime.
Recovery-v13 emits only `StreamProfileChange`; it owns the exact token-ledger
`ProfileManagementReceipt` transaction, and only its achieved token witness
plus fixed next profile may reach the terminal manifest CAS. At the v11
boundary, ordinary fold remained recovery-v12 and disable could not drain a
non-`SEALED` lane; that limitation is the predecessor state closed by the
following v12 hidden-lifecycle tranche.
**Hidden F2 lifecycle tranche implemented:** 2026-07-29 — internal schema v12
replaces lifecycle state-v2 inline histories with lifecycle-v3 fixed-size
ledger-chain/current pointers and authenticated WAL-tail authority.
Recovery-v14 activates exact `StreamEnrollmentV2`, `StreamClaim`,
`StreamFoldV2`, `StreamDrainFold`, and `StreamLifecycleReceipt` owners.
Every cold opener and ordinary fold recovery-covers a fresh epoch claim before
Lance is invoked. The hidden quiesce path handles never-written and non-empty
lanes through restartable `OPEN → DRAINING → SEALED`, including terminal claim
recovery and reuse of an already-flushed receipt-bound cut. Later
resume/correction/retirement/maintenance/rebind discriminators decode
fail-closed; no public control or row-ingress surface is activated.
**Scope refactor accepted:** 2026-07-30 — the experimental profile retains
minimal current terminal authority and exact recovery evidence but drops the
planned replay mutation/checkpoints, chunked dead-letter manifest/history,
public management-history pagination, broad repair HTTP parity, speculative
payload pre-registration, and the unused attested/keyed CI pipeline. F5 now
uses one measured, bounded recovery-owned object plus current
`DEAD_LETTERED` tokens; correction is a fresh ordinary occurrence naming the
terminal predecessor. Existing v12 receipt-first idempotency and authenticated
WAL-tail evidence keep their persisted meanings.
**F3f exact DataBlock correction implemented:** 2026-08-01 — internal schema
v18 and recovery-v20 activate only the state-lock-held, stopped/offline
`cluster stream block show|correct` path. Inspection reconstructs the retained
immutable generation and re-proves validator evidence; correction validates a
complete bounded `REPLACE`/`WITHDRAW` overlay and publishes one pre-minted base
transaction plus one combined token-successor/correction-receipt/management-
receipt transaction through the sole manifest CAS while remaining `DRAINING`.
The genuine v17↔v18 rebuild/refusal seam passes. At this milestone the reserved
`AuthorityBlock` vocabulary, public row/lifecycle surfaces, and F5b dead-letter
authority remained inactive.
**Hidden F4 ingest milestone implemented:** 2026-08-01 — the caller-shaped
authorized JSON/NDJSON path and bodyless lazy-enrollment prepare handshake are
closed behind feature-gated, doc-hidden engine seams. They exercise checked
runtime/policy authority, bounded incremental parsing and admission, dense
schema normalization, idempotent token chaining, and recovery-v14 enrollment
without activating an SDK, HTTP, CLI, or OpenAPI surface.
**Format-neutral F5a fold supervisor implemented:** 2026-08-01 — one weakly
root-scoped, process-local supervisor automatically folds `OPEN` lanes through
the existing recovery-v14 adapter. Detached ownership creates the timer wake
immediately after physical put invocation, so cancellation or eventual
`AckUnknown` cannot erase possibly durable work; passive readiness filters a
no-effect wake, while generation-cap pressure makes the same entry urgent.
Cold start re-derives backlog from manifest and authenticated MemWAL authority;
finite rounds visit nodes before edges with a carried round-robin cursor inside
each immutable-identity cohort; and retryable failures back off. After listener
bind the cluster server starts every selected supervisor. Graceful shutdown
fences root MemWAL opportunity exclusively, then profile authority exclusively,
drops both gates, and joins the driver before it again owns the profile and
every resident lane admission while aborting process-local writers and joining
idle authority owners. The complete cleanup is detached: cancellation or the bounded caller
deadline cannot release offline authority ahead of it, and any terminal failure
retains that authority fail-closed. No manifest, token, sidecar, or recovery grammar changed. F5b0
below closes goal-`SEALED` continuation and the offline disable owner; public
health/status and the currently unreachable `AuthorityBlock` repair remain
later work; the later F5b milestone below activates `DEAD_LETTERED` privately.
**Format-neutral F5b0 operational cut implemented:** 2026-08-01 — the exact
checked-runtime `ENABLED` supervisor now discovers and continues unblocked
`DRAINING(goal = SEALED)` rows through the existing recovery-v14 quiesce
owner. Checked stopped/offline apply publishes `DISABLING` before work,
derives one finite manifest lane cut, visits nodes before edges in deterministic
identity order one lane at a time, continues `OPEN` and goal-`SEALED` drains,
and narrows an existing `OPEN_AFTER_FOLD` drain through deterministic
recovery-v14 `DisableDrainAdoption`. A selected `DataBlock` leaves the exact
disable plan and observed cluster revision durably pending; a pre-schema apply
phase keeps schema and dependent query work behind that continuation, and exact
correction plus an apply rerun resumes it. The serving and offline owners do not overlap.
The live producer derives canonical request and occurrence values, while the
already-registered recovery-v14 validator retains its historical accepted
meaning; any future tightening requires a new recovery strand. No manifest,
token, sidecar, recovery, public API, or transport grammar changed.
**F5b terminal dead-letter slice implemented:** 2026-08-02 — internal schema
v19 upgrades current-token authority to schema v3 and recovery-v21 owns one
deterministic mixed/all-diverted fold. Valid winners remain visible; each losing
terminal candidate is recorded in one bounded canonical NDJSON object and one
current `DEAD_LETTERED` token. An all-diverted generation still advances the
base table through a marker-only transaction. Exact retry returns the terminal
result while current, and a fresh ordinary successor naming that predecessor
can restore `PRESENT`. Stopped/offline `cluster stream dead-letter list|export`
reads the selected token version and verifies payload descriptors without a
prefix listing or second inventory. Recovery-v21 also extends irreversible
retirement to exact `WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED` cuts; recovery-v19 and
recovery-v20 retain their historical meanings. This activates no HTTP, SDK,
remote CLI, or OpenAPI row surface. F6b3 now owns the exact-selected uncovered-
tail current-token hit/miss and terminal-page harness, F6b7 later adds paired
failpoints-only selected-index decision evidence, and F6b4 owns isolated
production-size dead-letter encoding/materialization and peak-RSS evidence.
F6b7's uncompacted-profile-cycle bounded NO-GO schedules no standalone recovery-
owned production token-index reconciler; the complete guardrail matrix remains.
**F6a in-process acceptance slice implemented:** 2026-08-02 — a typed
failpoints-only snapshot exposes process-local driver run state, pending
trigger/backoff scheduling, and last completion/error evidence as explicitly
non-authoritative diagnostics. Pending triggers are not a durable backlog, and
a stopped driver is not proof of checked stopped/offline authority. One hidden
candidate-runtime test composes prepare, ordered NDJSON, an automatic mixed
visible/dead-letter fold, stopped/offline selected-token list/export, an
ordinary corrected successor, driver restart, clean shutdown ownership, and
checked offline disable. Public durable `Omnigraph::stream_status` remains
manifest-only. This slice adds no format/recovery or public API/SDK/HTTP/CLI/
OpenAPI contract and does not complete F6. Later F6b2 closes the named process,
fairness, and maintenance/rebind/resume cells, and F6b3 closes the uncovered-
tail current-token hit/miss and terminal-page instrument. F6b7 later adds the
paired token-index decision instrument; at that boundary operational-status
transport and the remaining guardrails kept F7 forbidden. F7a/F7b later
activated graph row ingress and graph-redacted checked status; F7c later
activated selector-free graph-wide resume and checked `SEALED` maintenance;
F6b4 separately closes the isolated dead-letter envelope evidence and F6b5
closes bounded served export.
**F6b1 checked immutable export-cut slice implemented:** 2026-08-02 — an exact
managed `DISABLED | RETIRED` applied row, or exact graph/state evidence which
the engine accepts only for unmanaged `RETIRED` or enrolled `DISABLED`, can
mint a distinct lower/control-authority guard and engine capability that shares
the sole process-local serving registration without authorizing a writer.
Retirement confirmation CAS-converges a managed row to its exact `RETIRED`
revision; refresh preserves declaration identity and treats it as satisfying
`streaming: false`. Ambient enrolled ordinary `DISABLED` export refuses before
output. F6b1 retained the receipt-verified `RETIRED` direct/server export as
the irreversible-retirement rebuild bridge; F6b5 now switches served transport
to the checked cut. Both retain the exclusive side of the same root gate
through output. The doc-hidden capture seam nonwaitingly reserves that exclusive gate,
settles recovery, and closes profile/admission/schema/branch/token/table gates
while it validates terminal authority and filters and freezes
the accepted catalog, selected branch snapshot's exact table versions, and
retired provenance. It then drops every gate into a private-field, non-cloneable
cut that retains checked authority and the exclusive gate through consuming output, so a
later writer cannot retarget it. Branch create/create-from/delete, schema apply,
cleanup, and supported whole-root deletion acquire the shared side nonwaitingly;
they remain mutually concurrent and cannot remove or reuse a selected
path/version under the cut.
Terminal/refusal errors precede bytes; a
post-start storage/writer failure remains that stream error. This changes no
format or recovery grammar and activates no HTTP, SDK, remote CLI, OpenAPI,
bounded channel/byte reservation, deadline, stall/disconnect handling,
measurement, or public status surface. F6b5 subsequently closed the transport terms;
the remaining matrix stays in the F6b remainder/F7 boundary.
**F6b2 process/lifecycle acceptance slice implemented:** 2026-08-02 — green existing
server and hidden engine cells cover Unix `SIGTERM` through the shared
graceful-shutdown path; sequential OS-process exit/reopen with persisted
recovery; a frozen finite round where a newly ready node cannot overtake an
already captured edge; and terminal disable → same-schema physical rebind →
re-enable → reopen → explicit resume → exactly-once ingest/fold. The composed
`quiesce -> EnsureIndices -> Optimize -> resume` and checked-cut fresh-target
import cells are green too. The focused legacy Mutation/Load/delete,
`load_file`, and corresponding `_as` refusal matrix is green under `ENABLED`
and interrupted `DISABLING`; F6b2 is implemented.
Resident-producing served puts use bounded preprocessing/inflight → root
MemWAL opportunity shared → profile shared → table admission. The driver holds
root opportunity exclusive across its frozen finite round and takes
profile/admission per candidate; both permit kinds retain the worker-registry
`Arc`, preventing weak-root fence ABA. Shutdown fences root opportunity
exclusive and then profile exclusive, drops both, and joins the driver.
F6b8 adds the previously excluded resume owner to this root fence. Its producer
permit is a mandatory move-only input to detached installation and remains
embedded in the exclusive authority through every retained-retirement path.
Resume arms the urgent driver trigger before transfer; under the exclusive
root fence the driver retires only exact empty owners before preserving the
ordinary node-before-edge candidate order. Process-local gates remain only
sequential sole-writer evidence, not a distributed fence. The broader post-
claim install/retirement-failure matrix remains later F6 work.
Productive SchemaApply stays refused on enrolled graphs: EXP schema evolution
is checked sealed/retired export followed by fresh init/load, while physical
rebind keeps accepted schema unchanged. F6b7 closes the paired failpoints-only
token-index decision instrument and F6b5 closes bounded stream-aware served
export. Its uncompacted-profile-cycle bounded NO-GO schedules no standalone
production reconciler; public operational-status
transport and the other served surfaces remain later F6b/F7 work. F6b4
separately closes the isolated dead-letter envelope evidence.
**F6b3 exact-selected uncovered-tail evidence implemented:** 2026-08-02 — a
fixed-cardinality fixture grows immutable token-ledger receipt history through
zero-lane profile cycles before enrollment; graph-manifest history also
advances during that setup. It then creates exactly one current
`DEAD_LETTERED` key. A normal local 1/8-cycle cell plus ignored local and
configured-RustFS 1/8/32/128 sweeps record, per sample, the selected token
version, total/covered/uncovered fragments, terminal-entry count and serialized
page bytes, and cumulative advisory whole-process peak RSS. Within the measured
windows, fresh-handle hit/miss plus the first terminal page and same-handle warm
hit/miss plus repeat terminal pages report token-read counts, total table-store
read bytes, manifest reads/bytes, adapter-operation counts, and per-sample
warm/repeat p50 plus max-of-eight latency. “Fresh handle” does not claim a cold graph open or cold
provider cache: graph open and offline-authority setup occur before timing, and
coverage is a separate sample-level probe. The terminal page keeps one logical
entry, not byte-identical content, as receipt history changes. This instrument
does not query receipt keys. It refuses writes, MemWAL/base reads, prefix
listing, and dead-letter payload-object reads. Production has no authority-safe
token-index reconciler, so this remains explicitly F6b3 uncovered-tail evidence; it
neither calls raw `optimize_indices` nor publishes an index-only/reconciled token
HEAD. Fixture setup necessarily publishes ordinary receipt and terminal token
versions. At the F6b3 boundary, receipt-key cost and paired covered/reconciled
evidence remained later work; F6b7 closes that measurement gap without adding
public status or production maintenance.
**F6b4 dead-letter envelope evidence implemented:** 2026-08-02 — the existing
codec boundary cell remains the fast one-under/exact/one-over regression, while
an ignored production-size cell drives 8,192 adversarial candidates through the
real canonical-payload encoder/verifier at 67,108,863, 67,108,864, and
67,108,865 encoded bytes. On the accepted local macOS run, 10,364,432
source-value bytes became 62,301,270 canonical-payload input bytes and exact
67,108,864-byte encoded length/capacity. The cap-aware writer reduced retained
encoded capacity from an observed 132,644,864 bytes to the exact cap. Encoding
took 286,280 microseconds and verification took 2,254,424 microseconds. The
verifier and stopped/offline payload exporter retain canonical payloads as raw
JSON rather than recursively materializing nested `serde_json::Value` trees;
the JSON value and schema are unchanged, while lexical object-member order may
now preserve the stored canonical payload instead of the old
`serde_json::Value` reserialization order. The paired subprocess recorded
85,557,248-byte baseline and 231,849,984-byte exact peak RSS, a
146,292,736-byte lift beneath a 201,326,592-byte (192-MiB) one-sided
remeasurement tripwire. These are 2026-08-02 local measurements, not admission,
quota, or an SLO. The real overflow integration proves durable operational
`DataBlock` evidence precedes canonical-object creation, base-table effect, and
a current-token terminal-disposition transition; manifest and token-ledger
state may advance to persist the block, and no recovery sidecar or partial fold
remains.
This slice changes no persisted or wire grammar, adds no production route, and
adds no CI topology. It keeps the existing hidden payload-export JSON
value/schema, changes the Rust DTO field from `serde_json::Value` to
`Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>`, and may therefore preserve a different
lexical object-member order when serialized. It also adds one source-guarded,
doc-hidden failpoints-only measurement seam.
**F6b5 bounded served-export transport implemented:** 2026-08-03 — the
existing `POST /graphs/{graph_id}/export` route now authorizes and reserves its
complete transport-queue envelope before capturing F6b1's immutable cut and
sending `200`. Pristine graphs retain ordinary export; cluster-served enrolled
graphs require exact terminal `DISABLED | RETIRED` authority. Invalid filters,
nonterminal/stale authority, current `WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED` tokens, a
second root cut, and transport saturation remain typed JSON pre-header errors.
Exact-version scans use an initial 8,192-row estimate and Lance's approximate
32-MiB decoded-byte target. Lance may emit a larger batch, so the scan settings
are not allocator admission. Blob descriptor batches are explicitly sliced to
one logical row before its complete Blob-property set is materialized; that
set and the row's encoded JSON remain indivisible scratch. JSONL emission
splits independently owned chunks at 64 KiB. The server queue holds two chunks
and reserves a complete 256-KiB queue envelope per response plus a 2-MiB
process queue total under a 250-ms deadline. This is not a whole-response or
RSS bound. The response body and producer jointly retain the permit; the cut
stays in the in-flight producer or a terminal frame behind all data, so stall
backpressures and completion/disconnect/error release both owners. A
missing producer terminal is a body error rather than clean EOF. Remote CLI
streams the same response and OpenAPI pins `409 | 413 | 503`. This changes no
persisted grammar and activates no row-ingress, lifecycle, maintenance, or
public status surface.
**F6b6 checked operational-status core implemented:** 2026-08-03 — one
engine-internal read-only operation first runs token/base parity, its bounded
terminal sample, token-index coverage, and selected lifecycle-ledger proofs on
exact immutable versions under a separate 60-second observation budget without
holding writer gates. It then waits at most five seconds for the root fold
round, profile, every selected lane, schema, main branch, token, and table
gates; validates that the manifest and recovery inventory still select that
preflight; observes durable lifecycle, physical shard/generation, the accepted
recovery inventory, advisory process-local driver state, and rebuild blockers;
then rereads only mutable physical, recovery, and manifest authority before
release. The terminal sample is collected during the parity scan rather than
by a second full token scan. Unexplained movement is typed
`StreamStatusChanged`; either bounded phase can return `StreamStatusBusy`;
neither path heals recovery or publishes state.
The recovery inventory is complete within a hard status-only envelope of 256
matching direct `.json` sidecars, 256 irrelevant direct-or-nested objects
encountered below the prefix, 4 MiB of cumulative input-anchored URI bytes
across all encountered objects, 32 MiB per sidecar body, and 32 MiB of
cumulative bodies. Exceeding any bound returns a typed resource refusal; status
never truncates the set and never mistakes a partial inventory for rebuild
readiness.
`ENABLED` requires the checked served runtime, while terminal
`DISABLED | RETIRED` requires checked served-export authority. `DISABLING`
requires its explicit checked cluster-apply status authority; ambient offline
authority is not accepted. Every pending recovery sidecar in an accepted
inventory is included and blocks rebuild. A sidecar that exactly explains a moved physical HEAD makes the
affected physical observation unavailable; unexplained movement remains typed
`StreamStatusChanged`. Resident and verified-empty `SEALED` pending-generation
accounting can be exact. Cold replay is `UnavailableColdReplay`, because
counting it read-only would mutate Lance cursor state or claim a writer, and a
flushed LWW projection is `UnavailableFlushed`. Token-index uncovered counts
are exact when Lance exposes coverage, but oldest-uncovered age is explicitly unavailable
because the selected cut has no exact fragment-creation timestamp. The
existing public `Omnigraph::stream_status` remains manifest-only and
nonblocking. This F6b6 slice added no CLI/HTTP/OpenAPI/SDK transport; the
implemented F7b slice now owns the served graph-redacted wire contract.
**F6b7 selected token-index decision instrument implemented:** 2026-08-03 — the
F6b3 fixture now takes paired observations over the same logical authority. It
measures current-token and profile-management-receipt hit/miss work on the
manifest-selected uncovered cut, runs one failpoints-only content-identical
lookup-index refresh, selects the exact successor witness, and repeats those
lookups plus the bounded terminal page. The helper first settles recovery,
excludes token writers, proves raw HEAD equals manifest selection, and accepts
only the named index's one-version `CreateIndex` effect. Fragment set, schema,
row count, token result, receipt identity, and terminal-page contents must remain
unchanged; the after-cut must cover the complete fragment set. The measured
maintenance window contains `optimize_indices`, exact transaction
classification, and manifest selection. Gate/coordinator setup, the pre/post
content proofs, and final graph refresh run outside that window. This is test/
failpoints evidence only: it owns no recovery
sidecar, changes no format or wire contract, and is neither the production
authority-safe reconciler nor its scheduling threshold. Ordinary graph
`optimize` still does not maintain `_stream_tokens.lance`.
**Configured-RustFS uncompacted profile-cycle result — bounded NO-GO:** exact uncovered-fragment samples
were 6/20/68/260. Each warm current-token and profile-receipt hit/miss term had
a 3.000× token-table read-request ratio, while total maintenance-request break-even grew
45/136/448/1,697 calls. The corresponding byte ratios were
19.267×/10.913×/4.849×/2.084× with byte break-even at 12/20/46/150 calls. At
260 fragments the byte term still qualified, but the request term exceeded the
1,000-call ceiling, so the predeclared AND rule rejects a standalone production
reconciler for this fixture. This is not a universal token-index NO-GO.
Remeasure beyond 260 uncovered fragments, after a Lance/index-grammar change, or
before considering graph-manifest-compacted or checked-Optimize-coupled
maintenance; F6b7 schedules no standalone production maintenance.
**F6b8 resume/driver handoff implemented:** 2026-08-03 — resume now moves the
non-clone root producer permit into the detached install owner and its retained
retirement authority, then arms an urgent trigger before making that transfer.
Under the same exclusive root fence, the driver snapshots exact empty owners
and retires them under lane-exclusive authority as housekeeping before the
unchanged node-before-edge round. Productive residents cannot enter the
prepass. Deterministic driver-first and caller-cancelled resume-first cells pin
the fence transfer, a lower-sorted cold tail publishing in the same first round
without a driver error, and shutdown waiting for detached ownership. The
broader post-claim install/retirement-failure matrix remains in F6. This slice
changes no persisted or wire grammar and activates no public surface.
**F7b graph-safe operational status implemented:** 2026-08-04 — the served
`GET /graphs/{graph_id}/stream/status` route and remote `stream status` CLI
project F6b6's checked cut at graph level. The response contains logical node/
edge declarations whose streaming state has initialized, lifecycle and drain phase, aggregate token/recovery/pending
evidence, logical rebuild blockers, and advisory driver state. It contains no
table key, stable/incarnation/binding/enrollment/shard/writer/generation or
dataset identity, and no opaque operation, actor, control-token, or graph-
commit identifier. The route uses graph `read` authorization, sends
`Cache-Control: no-store`, and returns typed pre-response refusals for missing
checked authority, a changing/busy cut, or an exceeded observation bound. It
never heals recovery, mutates lifecycle, creates evidence for an unmanaged
graph, or returns a partial inventory. One nonwaiting observation slot per
graph root and one per serving process bounds concurrent immutable scans. The embedded manifest-only status API
is unchanged. This slice changes no format, recovery grammar, coordinator, or

## 0. Decision and risk posture

OmniGraph adopts Lance MemWAL as its strategic streaming-write architecture.
MemWAL is a major Lance architectural bet: a sharded LSM write path with durable
WAL entries, flushed Lance generations, merge progress committed with base-table
data, maintained indexes, and epoch-fenced writers. OmniGraph consumes that
architecture rather than building a WAL, shard protocol, or LSM reader.

This RFC does **not** characterize the architecture as experimental. The risk is
narrower: Rust API names, some format details, and operational helpers are still
maturing across Lance releases. We manage that API/format-maturity risk with a
small adapter, compile/runtime surface guards, a quiescence requirement before
Lance upgrades, and a fresh full-spec alignment audit on every bump. It is not a
reason to fork or reimplement MemWAL.

One RC.1 API gap prevents the ideal enrollment adapter, not the bounded
evidence work:
`InitializeMemWalBuilder::execute` internally commits the MemWAL `CreateIndex`
transaction and returns only `Result<()>`, while initial shard-manifest creation
is a separate object-store effect reached through `mem_wal_writer`. The public
surface therefore cannot provide the caller-minted transaction identity and
reversible cross-process admission seal required by the general profile in
§3/§8. OmniGraph does not reach through private Lance modules or hand-roll
those objects. It also does not make upstream release timing a calendar
prerequisite: Gate E0 below confirms that a deliberately narrower profile can
classify the public effects exactly under OmniGraph's existing
single-live-writer-process boundary. The exact upstream receipt/seal remains
the preferred simplification and the gate for broader topology.

The contract is:

- stream acknowledgement means every row in one submitted Lance batch has
  crossed that batch's durability watcher and the same private B1
  `ShardWriter` has then passed `check_fenced()` at the acknowledgement
  boundary; it does not promise one WAL entry or an addressable WAL position
  per row;
- acknowledgement does not mean graph visibility;
- default queries see only the manifest-committed graph;
- a fold is an ordinary RFC-022 graph writer and is the sole visibility point;
- fresh reads are explicit and never claim cross-table atomicity.

### 0.1 Gate E0: bounded-enrollment decision passed before activation

Gate E0 is a production-neutral decision harness, not streaming activation. It
uses the pinned public Lance surface to establish that one exact first
enrollment can be classified after success, failure, and lost acknowledgement
without deleting or adopting ambiguous state. Its evidence-backed initial
profile is:

- `main` only;
- one unsharded keyed-upsert shard per enrolled table;
- one live OmniGraph writer process for the graph, with a crash successor only
  after external exclusivity has been established;
- no raw Lance writer and no overlapping second OmniGraph writer process; and
- exclusive ownership of the enrolled table's base HEAD while the stream is
  `OPEN`: only the stream fold/recovery adapter may advance it. Every other
  graph writer, branch/schema operation, repair, index/optimize path, or cleanup
  that touches the table must refuse before effect or first drain the stream.

Gate E0 itself added no manifest rows, sidecars, `@stream`, public APIs, WAL
acknowledgements, or a format stamp. The Phase A implementation authorized by
that result has now activated internal schema v7 and the bounded production
foundation described in §12.2: recoverable empty enrollment, durable lifecycle
authority, process-local admission/exclusion, and strict format
refusal/rebuild. At that boundary it exposed no production enrollment entry
point and could not append or acknowledge a row. RFC-026 remains draft, but
later F7a–F7c now expose graph-native served ingress, graph-redacted status,
graph-wide resume, and checked `SEALED` maintenance.

The implementation remains deliberately split. Historical **Phase B1** supplied
one admission-bounded, no-roll generation from admission through crash replay
and strict fold mechanics. The 2026-07-21 dense-scan repair closes the legal
near-cap row shape that Gate R0 exposed. The private **B2a unbounded
retain-all** evidence gate is also implemented: stock Lance owns the WAL,
OmniGraph never deletes or
reclaims a canonical durable MemWAL object, and physical storage is allowed to
grow monotonically without a file, object, or byte quota. Lance may delete its
own losing `.binpb.tmp.<uuid>` shard-manifest CAS staging files before they
become canonical objects; this is atomic-write cleanup, not MemWAL GC. **B2b**
remains the deferred managed-reclamation profile using a Lance-owned primitive.

The private B2 row/fold slice introduced in internal schema v9 remains part of
the currently served v19 format. It supplies stream-config v3, canonical
payload/token digests, trusted hidden row attribution, and manifest-selected
graph-global token authority. Admission
recaptures mutable authority after shared admission and same-key queue
ownership. V12 replaces lifecycle state-v2 with lifecycle-v3 fixed-size
ledger-chain/current and authenticated-tail authority. Recovery-v14 owns exact
hidden enrollment, claims, ordinary/drain folds, and terminal management
receipts; a fold publishes exact base plus token effects, lifecycle, lineage,
and attribution only at one manifest CAS. Recovery-v11 is historical v8 state,
and historical recovery-v12 lifecycle-v2 folds are refused under lifecycle-v3.
Recovery-v15 owns private resume and guarded drain-abort without reinterpreting
the v14 scaffold. The core
remains reachable only through feature-gated, doc-hidden engine test seams and
is not a product surface. V11's profile protocol v2 and exact recovery-v13
`StreamProfileChange` remain unchanged.

The remaining public per-declaration enrollment/quiesce/abort,
`AuthorityBlock` correction, physical status, rebind, and direct-SDK parity
contracts in §4.1–§4.4 and §4.6 still apply. Narrow stopped/offline
`DataBlock` correction, selected-current-token
dead-letter list/export, and terminal authority retirement are the cluster-only
operator exceptions.
`GraphHistoryBudget`, physical-storage admission, and aggregate receipt-capacity
reservations do not. The graph-scoped Cedar vocabulary and embedded
manifest-only status are active under §4.7. F7a adds served graph ingress, F7b
graph-redacted checked status, and F7c selector-free graph-wide resume plus
checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize; schema intent, per-declaration/general
lifecycle control, direct-SDK control, and a public same-key `AckUnknown` retry
contract remain unimplemented. `DISABLING` persists an exact restart/resume
plan and drain-only continuation, and checked offline cluster apply is the
production owner that drains its finite cut to `SEALED`.

### 0.2 Gate R0: historical bounded-retention result and current disposition

**Gate R0 asked one question:** under the existing main-only, unsharded,
one-live-writer-process boundary and the pinned stock Lance surface, could
OmniGraph place a finite, source-derived upper bound on every retained
`_mem_wal` effect while deleting nothing, and reserve enough of that bound
before acknowledgement for the admitted generation to fold, be corrected if
necessary, quiesce, and reach `SEALED`?

Gate R0 is production-neutral. It adds no manifest authority row, recovery kind,
format stamp, `@stream` syntax, production enrollment or row caller,
SDK/HTTP/CLI/OpenAPI/Cedar surface, and performs no `_mem_wal` deletion. Its
checked-in decision instrument inventories current listed objects by WAL,
shard-manifest, generation-data, generation-manifest/transaction/deletion,
PK-sidecar, Bloom, and user-index class. Unknown paths fail closed; all listed
immutable paths must retain the same path, class, and listed size between
retain-all checkpoints. This is current-object evidence only: ordinary listing
cannot prove content identity, incomplete
multipart uploads, superseded provider versions, delete markers, local staged
temporary files, or billed storage.

**Historical Gate R0 result (2026-07-20): no-go for bounded retain-all on stock
Lance RC.1.** Three findings were recorded:

1. A flush chooses a fresh randomized generation directory, writes the
   generation dataset, optional deletion state, Bloom filter, and mandatory PK
   sidecar, and only then attempts the shard-manifest CAS. A crash or error can
   retain an unreferenced partial/complete subtree. Reopen reconstructs the same
   logical generation from WAL and may choose another random directory. Stock
   Lance persists or enforces no attempt ID, attempt counter, reservation, or
   receipt that bounds materialization across cold opens. Individual process or
   provider retries may be configured, but they are not represented in MemWAL
   authority and repeated reopen can accumulate additional attempts.
2. RC.1 exposes no admission-grade, reserve-first conservative
   physical-output estimator or complete post-attempt storage receipt. The
   32-MiB logical dense-slice Arrow admission cap is not a source-derived bound for
   data/Blob/transaction/manifest/deletion/PK/Bloom objects, local staging
   residue, or multipart/provider residue. Measurements can validate a formula;
   they cannot create one.
3. The historical pre-B2-attribution deterministic high-entropy near-cap cell
   acknowledged a legal 33,228,232-byte logical post-tombstone Arrow generation
   and retained 33,174,630 currently listed immutable bytes after
   acknowledgement. Materialization raised the listed retained total to about
   65.1 million bytes. The old fold
   retained sparse `LsmScanner` slices whose variable-width arrays still owned
   their much larger backing buffers, so its logical-byte check charged roughly
   252.8 million bytes against the 33,554,432-byte generation limit and refused
   closure.

The success-only sweep remains useful but does not override those blockers:
one/four/eight referenced generation roots retain approximately 37.4 / 150.6 /
302.3 thousand currently listed immutable bytes locally, every earlier listed
path retains its class and size, and a
retry after the referenced cut reuses the exact generation root. Configured
RustFS Gate-R0 growth evidence and the actual 8,192-one-row decision-scale run
were not needed for the 2026-07-20 decision, and no numeric result from either
is claimed here. The configured RustFS cell is now wired as a post-merge/tag
regression signal.

The 2026-07-21 amendment changes the disposition, not those measurements. The
first two findings remain true, but they are limitations only of a
finite-storage promise. B2a now makes no such promise: it has no MemWAL GC, no
file/object/byte ceiling, no retained-storage admission watermark, no
source-derived physical-output envelope, and no requirement that stock Lance
return a materialization-attempt receipt. Referenced generations, WAL, fence
sentinels, and unreferenced partial or complete materialization subtrees are
retained indefinitely. Parent `_mem_wal` listing may observe an orphan prefix
while discovering shard authority, but production never descends into its
subtree, reads it as a generation, mutates it, deletes it, or adopts it from
path shape. Ordinary `cleanup` never treats it as reclaimable. Operators must
provision the backing store accordingly. Provider exhaustion remains an explicit
storage failure handled by the existing pre-/post-invocation and recovery
rules; it is never permission to acknowledge, discard, or fabricate success.

The third finding is fixed. `scan_fresh_generation` now validates the streamed
logical row/byte totals and then takes every selected row into dense owned Arrow
arrays before retaining the batch. Dropping the sparse scanner batch releases
its oversized backing buffers before the next slice. The historical
pre-B2-attribution 33,228,232-byte generation then folded all 8,192 rows,
advanced the base table once, and became graph-visible at exactly one
`__manifest` publication. The current B2-attributed Gate-R0 fixture and RSS
evidence are recorded in §12.3 and §12.4. The 384-MiB delta tripwire requires
remeasurement before the admission or compaction shape is widened. This is
measured process memory, not a physical-storage quota. The 8,192-row and
32-MiB logical generation limits, one-resident-writer topology, exclusive-fold
ownership, typed failures, and recovery barriers all remain.

This decision and repair did not themselves authorize internal schema
v9/config-v3/state-v2/recovery-v12 state, a public stream contract, a production
caller, or deletion. The subsequent private B2 slice activates that format and
recovery state without changing retain-all or adding a product surface. Gate R0
only removed bounded physical retention from the critical path and made the
already-private B1 generation close for the widest
admitted shape. Public activation still requires the correctness and product
gates in §12.6.

## 1. Scope and non-goals

This RFC specifies enrollment, the public stream API, acknowledgement semantics,
folding, fold-time integrity, dead-letter atomicity, branch/schema quiescence,
fresh-read cuts, resource bounds, observability, testing, and upgrade posture.

It does not replace `load` or `mutate`, provide cross-query transactions, store
manifest mutations in MemWAL, create a competing metadata authority, or weaken
default snapshot isolation. Stream-mode
deletes remain out of the first delivery and require the Lance tombstone surface
plus a separate acceptance pass.

The narrow initial main-only topology additionally excludes non-main streams,
multi-shard ownership, overlapping writer processes, raw Lance writers,
cross-process `Fresh`, and concurrent interactive/maintenance HEAD movement on
an `OPEN` enrolled table. These are support-boundary refusals, not implicit
eventual-consistency modes.

## 2. Stream mode and key semantics

Phase B1 has no schema syntax and uses one fixed internal
`mode="upsert", on_reject="strict"` profile. Phase B2 initially exposes only
`@stream(mode="upsert", on_reject="strict")` on a node or edge type.
`on_reject="dead_letter"` remains a typed unsupported choice until Phase C
proves a restart-stable reject-row identity, consumes B2's durable contributor
attribution, and proves atomic rejection and retention.
It requires the table's immutable unenforced primary key to equal OmniGraph's
merge key: `id` for nodes and edges. All occurrences of one key map to one shard
and MemWAL applies last-write-wins ordering.

Initial B2 admission is self-contained and provider-free. The caller supplies
every required physical value, including vectors; the engine may perform only
version-pinned deterministic parsing, defaults, and normalization before token
mint. `@stream` is rejected at accepted-schema validation for a type whose
write path requires `@embed`, an external provider, or any other post-request
derived-field materialization. Runtime rechecks the accepted capability before
admission. A client may compute embeddings first and submit the physical vector,
but streaming never acknowledges a provider-dependent promise and retries never
re-call an external model under the same `write_id`.

Every stream contract is bound to RFC-028's
`(stable_table_id, incarnation_id)` pair. A rename preserves that pair, so the
logical stream contract and ownership of reject history remain continuous.
That continuity does **not** authorize adoption of physical WAL artifacts. A
same-dataset rename preserves the current physical enrollment. In future Phase
D, a SchemaApply that rematerializes the table may bind the preserved logical
pair to a fresh physical enrollment and fresh shard namespace through §3 and
§8; the EXP profile does not activate that writer and instead uses
checked-export/fresh-target rebuild for schema evolution. Dropping and later
re-adding the same name mints a new pair; the new table
cannot adopt the old table's WAL, lifecycle row, reject rows, epochs, or merge
progress.

Public append mode is deliberately out of scope. Nodes and edges always have
logical identity; allowing a retry to append the same `id` twice would violate
that contract. A future explicitly keyless, non-graph append-only table class
may consume MemWAL append semantics under its own schema/API decision.

Stream ordering intentionally differs from the interactive fence. Lance still
resolves physical rows by generation/position LWW, but B2 does not expose
unconstrained arrival-order LWW as its retry contract. §4.1 admits a physical
row only when its predecessor token matches the current per-key stream token:

- interactive same-key writes on an unenrolled table serialize or fail/retry
  loudly. Once the table is enrolled, ordinary Mutation/Load remains refused
  before effect for `OPEN`, `DRAINING`, **and `SEALED`** in B2. Draining enables
  only the proved export/rebuild path plus §4.7 P7's explicitly integrated
  non-content maintenance bridge; it does not let a direct write bypass
  `_stream_tokens`. A later phase must define a token-aware direct-write
  transition and witness/rebind update before relaxing this refusal;
- same-key public stream entries form an explicit compare-and-chain sequence;
  MemWAL generation/position order realizes only that already-validated chain;
- duplicate keys inside one bulk-load input retain the existing load error.

The schema and user docs state all three together.

## 3. Enrollment is a recoverable multi-effect adapter

In the eventual Phase-B2 public contract, SchemaApply records `@stream` intent
and first stream use enrolls the physical table by creating the singleton
`__lance_mem_wal` system index and its sharding configuration. Phase A does not
yet parse or persist that intent. It implements the enrollment machinery behind
a crate-private method and a feature-gated failpoint seam, using one fixed
main-only/unsharded configuration so recovery and exclusion can be proven
before a production caller exists.

RFC-024 heads are optional. Every lifecycle row therefore carries two distinct
classes of evidence:

```text
StreamPhysicalBinding {
    stable_table_id,
    incarnation_id,
    table_location,
    table_branch,         // exactly main in the bounded profile
    enrollment_id,       // pre-minted UUID, never reused
    shard_ids,           // sorted UUID namespace, never reused
    stream_config_version,
    stream_config_hash,
}

CurrentHeadWitness {
    branch_identifier,
    table_version,
    transaction_uuid,
    manifest_e_tag,
}
```

`StreamPhysicalBinding` is stable for one physical enrollment. The
`CurrentHeadWitness` is not: it is the exact public Lance composite at the
currently accepted base HEAD, using the same capture discipline as RFC-024.
Every ordinary Lance commit changes at least the table version and current
transaction UUID and normally the manifest e_tag. Calling that composite a
stable “physical-ref incarnation” is incorrect.

The lifecycle binding is valid only when the current manifest table entry
resolves to the same stable table/incarnation and location/main ref, its
persisted `CurrentHeadWitness` equals the physical table's current witness, and
the table contains the expected singleton MemWAL index plus exactly the
recorded shard namespace/configuration. Path, branch name, numeric version,
timestamp, or the RFC-028 logical incarnation alone is never sufficient. Local
and S3/RustFS same-path/ref delete-recreate guards must change the witness; a
backend without that proof cannot activate streaming.

The bounded profile makes the changing witness tractable by granting the
`OPEN` stream exclusive authority to advance that base-table HEAD. Every fold
captures the prior witness and publishes the achieved table pointer and next
witness in the same `__manifest` CAS. Any unexpected movement is foreign or
ambiguous and fails closed. A path that needs to mutate or maintain the table
must drain first and participate in the lifecycle/witness transition; it may
not silently coexist with an `OPEN` stream. A long-lived Lance tag is not the
default enrollment anchor: it would pin the enrollment-time table snapshot and
can retain an old full-table file set across rewrites/compaction, while also
adding another auxiliary effect to enrollment. It remains only a measured
fallback if a later profile requires concurrent base writers.

The MemWAL index UUID is not used as enrollment identity because Lance may
replace that metadata entry while advancing merged-generation state. A mutable
table name, the RFC-028 logical pair alone, or a compatible-looking index is
never enough. RFC-024 may project related table/ref facts into a durable head,
but RFC-026 persists and validates this binding without depending on heads.
For the bounded profile, the pre-minted `enrollment_id` is also persisted as a
namespaced MemWAL `writer_config_defaults` marker together with the exact
configuration version. RC.1 explicitly permits arbitrary persisted default
keys, and merge-progress/index-metadata replacement must preserve them. This is
classifier evidence independent of the replaceable MemWAL index UUID; the
manifest lifecycle row remains the logical stream authority.

Enrollment advances Lance HEAD and provisions shard-manifest objects. The
preferred general-profile substrate remains one of these public,
surface-guarded shapes:

1. a caller-controlled staged/uncommitted MemWAL initialization transaction
   with an exact transaction identity, plus idempotent public APIs to provision,
   classify, seal/reopen, and reclaim a pre-minted shard manifest; or
2. one recoverable enrollment primitive that returns an exact receipt covering
   both the index transaction and initial shard objects, with documented
   classify/roll-forward/rollback semantics.

The RC.1 `execute() -> Result<()>` initializer plus separately claimed shard
writer satisfies neither general shape. Private-module access,
compatible-looking index inference, and direct object-store emulation remain
rejected. Gate E0 established that the public effects are nevertheless exact
enough for the bounded profile. Internal schema v7 and the private Phase A
adapter now activate the format/recovery foundation. `@stream`, production
first use, WAL row admission, and acknowledgement remain publicly inactive.
Implemented Phase B1 reaches row admission only through a feature-gated private
engine seam; schema-declared first use remains Phase B2.

With Gate E0 green, the implemented bounded enrollment uses one RFC-022
multi-effect sidecar, not an ad-hoc state machine:

1. run and await RFC-022's synchronous recovery barrier;
2. authorize, pin the manifest/schema/table state, and prepare a complete
   `ReadSet` containing schema identity, stable table ID and incarnation,
   location/main ref, exact pre-enrollment `CurrentHeadWitness`, PK metadata,
   the fixed Phase A configuration, and lifecycle-row absence. Public
   production schema-declared intent and supported `SEALED` physical rebind remain later phases;
3. acquire any global claims and then the `(table, branch)` write queue in
   RFC-022 order, then freshly revalidate the complete `ReadSet`; a mismatch
   restarts before any physical effect;
4. verify RFC-023's already-installed PK; enrollment never performs a first-use
   PK migration; validate the sharding configuration;
5. pre-mint a never-reused enrollment UUID and one shard UUID, then arm a
   sidecar with writer kind `stream_enrollment`, the exact baseline witness,
   fixed intended binding/configuration (including the namespaced persisted
   enrollment marker), and the only allowed successor shape;
6. call the public initializer only while the base-HEAD/exclusive-admission
   gate is held. After success or a lost result, use the manifest-pinned direct
   physical URI opener at `VersionResolution::At(N)` (the evidence harness uses
   `DatasetBuilder::with_version(N)`), never latest resolution, and verify the
   exact captured `N` witness. Then use the pinned public
   `Dataset::has_successor_version` primitive to ask only whether `N + 1`
   exists. `Ok(false)` means no effect only while the same gate and cleanup/GC
   exclusion remain held. `Ok(true)` permits an exact `checkout_version(N + 1)`;
   that handle must report no `N + 2` successor before its transaction is
   accepted as exactly one singleton MemWAL `CreateIndex` reading `N`, with the
   intended unsharded configuration and no unrelated change. A probe error,
   overflow, detached-version boundary, same-version ABA, or existing `N + 2`
   is ambiguous and returns `RecoveryRequired`;
7. pass the pre-minted UUID to the public shard-writer path and accept only its
   exact empty initial shard state: expected shard/spec identity, epoch 1,
   generation 1, replay/cursor positions 0, no flushed generation, and no
   data-bearing WAL entry. A deterministic
   data-less fence sentinel is admissible only if Gate E0 first pins it as part
   of that exact state;
8. once either allowed effect exists, recover only by rolling forward to the
   fixed outcome. The bounded adapter never deletes/reclaims shard artifacts or
   restores the base table from inferred ownership. Intervening HEAD movement,
   a wrong index/config, a foreign shard, unexpected WAL data, or any ambiguity
   retains the sidecar and returns `RecoveryRequired`;
9. publish the achieved table version, `CurrentHeadWitness`, stable physical
   binding, exact pre-claim epoch floor, and `stream_state = OPEN` in one
   manifest CAS, including the table-head row when RFC-024 is active; and
10. resolve the enrollment sidecar before any future `put` is admitted. Phase A
    has no put/ack caller; the implemented private Phase B1 path enters through
    this recovery barrier, so `OPEN` plus an unresolved enrollment can never
    acknowledge.

An exact no-effect intent may finalize without publication. The exact
index-only and index-plus-empty-shard states roll forward. No other state is
silently repaired, adopted, or rolled back. Repeating enrollment with the same
complete binding is a no-op only after exact validation. A different PK,
binding, sharding spec, maintained-index set, writer-default configuration, or
current-HEAD chain is a typed conflict.

No row is acknowledged until enrollment is manifest-committed, every sidecar
effect is resolved, and the exact bound shard is physically admitting writes.

The exclusive base-HEAD gate and cleanup/version-GC exclusion are load-bearing
from the final pre-effect check through classification and publication. Lance's
`has_successor_version` intentionally reports only whether the immediate next
manifest exists and may return false if an intermediate manifest was removed;
therefore recovery cannot interpret `Ok(false)` as no effect after cleanup was
allowed to race. The method is public but absent from the rendered guide, so a
compile/runtime surface guard pins it on every Lance bump.

RC.1 persists arbitrary writer defaults in the MemWAL index but does not apply
them to a caller-supplied `ShardWriterConfig`. The bounded adapter must therefore
reconstruct the exact persisted durable-write and buffer configuration before
opening the pre-minted shard; compatible defaults are not inferred. Recovery
classification refreshes the durable table tip and performs a read-only exact
inventory of the documented `_mem_wal/<shard>` layout. A foreign or malformed
prefix, loose object, unknown shard-manifest object, WAL entry, cursor movement,
or flushed generation fails closed. This inventory creates or mutates no raw
Lance object and is pinned by the Gate E0 guards on every Lance bump.

Initial delivery supports one unsharded shard per `(table, main)` and one live
writer process for the graph. Non-main branches remain refused until the Lance
branch-scoping question is proven by a surface guard and end-to-end test. Later
`bucket(id, N)` sharding must preserve the one-key-to-one-shard rule. General
overlapping-process enrollment/failover still requires the upstream receipt /
admission lifecycle or a separately accepted distributed fence.

The full non-experimental B2 contract leaves an `@stream` table `UNENROLLED`
until its standalone explicit enrollment request. The selected experimental
profile instead keeps enrollment private behind §4.7 P2's graph adapter. The
public bodyless step is the graph-authority ETag challenge, not a table prepare
or incarnation exchange. After an exact graph token transfers body ownership,
the first logical row for an absent declaration may invoke the existing
recovery-v14 `StreamEnrollmentV2` prepare before that row's admission. Its
fixed actor/witness intent and engine-minted result remain retained in
actor-bound `EnrollmentReceiptV2`; historical `protocol_v10` is not
reinterpreted. Same ID/actor/intent after an internal lost result returns that
receipt, another actor or intent conflicts, and concurrent prepare losers
converge through the winner's complete receipt. A disconnect after prepare may
leave an empty `OPEN` lane, which the existing lifecycle owner handles. The
adapter injects the private stream incarnation into the row call; the client
neither supplies nor observes it.

## 4. B2 contract and future public activation

This section owns both the implemented private B2 row/fold contract and the
remaining future-public/control contract. Internal schema v9 implemented the
§4.1 token/attribution substrate and historical recovery-v12 fold portion of
§4.4. V12 adds the hidden lifecycle-v3/recovery-v14 enrollment, claim, fold,
and quiesce core. V13/recovery-v15 adds crate-private resume and guarded
drain-abort. V14/recovery-v16 adds the crate-private, checked-runtime,
main-only `SEALED` EnsureIndices bridge; v15/recovery-v17 adds the distinct
checked-runtime, main-only `SEALED` Optimize bridge; v16/recovery-v18 adds the
separate private physical-rebind owner for an exact `SEALED` lane;
v17/recovery-v19 adds the cluster-only stopped/offline authority-retirement and
receipt-bearing export exit; v18/recovery-v20 adds the separate stopped/offline
exact `DataBlock` show/correct exit; and current v19/token-schema-v3/
recovery-v21 adds deterministic terminal diversion plus three-disposition
retirement. Those format slices themselves expose no production row caller or
maintenance transport; F7a later activates the graph row caller and F7c the
selector-free graph-wide resume/checked `SEALED` maintenance controls without a
format change. The
graph-scoped `stream_ingest` /
`stream_manage` Cedar vocabulary and embedded manifest-only read-only status
are active under §4.7; v11 profile mutation additionally requires checked
cluster-control/runtime ownership.
Supported explicit enrollment/quiesce/rebind, per-declaration/general lifecycle
control including abort-drain, `AuthorityBlock` repair, and direct SDK
status/control remain future gates. F7a activates graph-native served row
admission, F7b exposes a graph-redacted HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI projection of
F6b6's checked read-only operational-status core, and F7c exposes graph-wide
resume plus checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize over the same served
transports.
**B2a unbounded retain-all** is the selected first profile: it
deletes no MemWAL object and performs no physical-storage admission or
accounting. **B2b** is the deferred managed-reclamation profile through the
Lance-owned protocol in §4.5.2. B2a retains individually bounded protocol
records indefinitely, but EXP exposes no public audit-history pagination; it
has no aggregate receipt-count/byte cap, `GraphHistoryBudget`, retained-storage
quota, or closure-capacity reservation. In-place productive SchemaApply on an
enrolled graph stays refused in the EXP profile. Phase D owns automatic
operation-scoped drain and any future broader schema integration; §4.7 P7
pulls only the explicit `quiesce -> served same-binding maintenance -> resume`
bridge and the `stop -> disable to DISABLED -> offline physical rebind ->
enable -> restart -> resume` bridge into the experimental activation. Schema
evolution in EXP uses checked sealed/retired export, fresh initialization with
the desired schema, and ordinary load into that fresh graph; it never loads
over the enrolled source.

### 4.1 Durable row identity and same-key retry safety

B2 deliberately makes the public contract stricter than blind upsert. Every
input row carries a client-owned logical write token:

```text
StreamWriteEnvelope {
    stream_incarnation_id: UUID,        // exact logical stream incarnation
    write_id: UUID,                    // non-nil, stable across retries
    predecessor_token: StreamToken?,   // opaque exact token returned for id
}

TrustedStreamRowMetadata {
    stream_incarnation_id: UUID,
    contributor_id: String,            // server/engine derived; never client supplied
    write_id: UUID,
    predecessor_token: StreamToken?,
    stream_token: StreamToken,
    fold_base_token: StreamToken?,      // token before this generation's chain
    chain_depth: u32,                   // 1-based within this generation for id
    origin: Admission { admission_attempt_id: UUID, caller_ordinal: u64 }
          | Correction { correction_id: UUID, plan_ordinal: u64 },
    payload_digest: sha256,
}
```

`write_id` is the caller's idempotency label and remains stable for an exact
retry. The occurrence/idempotency key is `(table incarnation, stream
incarnation, logical id, predecessor_token, write_id)`. Authenticated
contributor and payload digest are immutable attributes bound to that key, not
a way to turn reuse of the same key into another change. A caller that
deliberately reuses the UUID against a newer predecessor is asking for a
distinct occurrence; SDKs still mint a fresh UUID for each new change.
An `Admission` attempt ID names one possibly ambiguous call to the private B1
worker; it is not a WAL position or receipt. `Correction` is a distinct durable
origin because correction creates no physical admission attempt. The current
implemented v9 row/token format (inside the current v19 graph wrapper) accepts
those two variants only. F5 correction of a terminal dead letter is a fresh
ordinary `Admission` occurrence with a new caller-owned `write_id` and the
current terminal token as predecessor; it adds no Replay origin. Exactly one
origin variant is present. `predecessor_token = null` means the caller expects
no earlier stream token, which covers both an absent row and a row that predates
public streaming. A blind wildcard predecessor is not supported because it
recreates the stale-retry overwrite.

`stream_incarnation_id` is minted when the logical token authority is created
and returned by status/enrollment. It survives a same-table physical rebind but
changes whenever a strict rebuild/re-enrollment resets token state. Every
request compares it before Lance is called; a mismatch is effect-free
`StreamBindingChanged`. This closes the null-predecessor ABA in which a delayed
first-write retry from an old root/enrollment could otherwise enter a freshly
empty token authority. Table drop/re-add is already fenced by the distinct
stable table incarnation, and the stream incarnation is checked as well.

`StreamToken` is an opaque 32-byte, versioned, domain-separated SHA-256 value
computed by the trusted engine from the stable table/incarnation, logical key,
stream incarnation, predecessor token, `write_id`, contributor, and payload
digest. It excludes the physical admission-attempt ID, so an exact retry derives
the same token. The caller only stores and echoes the bytes returned by
`durable`, `already_durable`, `withdrawn`, F5 `dead_lettered`, or authorized
`stream_sequence_conflict` results; it does not construct or parse them. B2's
stream status is lifecycle-level and exposes no per-key token lookup. An
unconfirmed candidate from `AckUnknown` is never a valid predecessor; the
caller retries that same occurrence against its original predecessor until it
receives a confirmed current/durable result or a sequence conflict. This hash
chain prevents a repeated UUID from making an old retry look current after
`X -> Y -> X`: those three occurrences have different full tokens because their
predecessors differ.

The v1 wire form of every 32-byte stream token, block token, and externally
asserted protocol digest is exactly `sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase
hexadecimal characters. No uppercase, padding, whitespace, alternate prefix,
or base64 form is accepted. Parsing verifies prefix, length, alphabet, and
canonical round-trip before any recovery or Lance call. Stream-config v3 pins
this `sha256-lowerhex-v1` representation; changing it requires a new wire/config
version rather than permissive dual decoding.

The trusted metadata is stored in one reserved nullable physical struct,
`__omnigraph_stream_v1$`, in every stream-capable base-table
schema. Pre-stream/direct rows have a null top-level struct. For a stream row,
the incarnation, contributor, write ID, stream token, chain depth, payload
digest, and origin tag are non-null; predecessor and fold-base tokens are
nullable when the chain begins at null. The tagged origin has variant-specific
nullability: exactly the `Admission` or `Correction` children selected by its
non-null tag are populated. The trailing `$` is deliberately outside the `.pg`
identifier grammar; accepted-SchemaIR validation still rejects a hand-authored
lookalike. The v8-valid user property `__omnigraph_stream_v1` (without `$`)
remains ordinary data and survives rebuild. Logical query results, ordinary
export, user schema reflection, and user-declared indexes never expose the
physical field. Lance therefore carries the exact
metadata atomically with the row through WAL, replay, flushed generation,
fold, and base-table publication. This is intentionally a base-schema field:
RC.1's `put_no_wait` accepts the base schema and adds only Lance's own
`_tombstone` field, so a sidecar column or private WAL rewrite would not be a
valid public integration.

The engine computes `payload_digest` after all pre-ack normalization,
defaulting, and materialization. Its versioned, domain-separated input includes
the stable table/incarnation, accepted schema hash, and deterministic
type-aware bytes of every logical field while excluding the stream metadata
itself. Blob content is hashed from the stored bytes, not from an external URI
descriptor; a payload that still requires post-ack dereferencing is not
self-contained and is refused. Stream-config v3 pins the digest version and
canonical encoding.

Before B2 can materialize a blob or allocate that canonical encoding, it must
reserve one root-scoped worst-case preprocessing envelope: the original legal
32-MiB Arrow row, a possible 32-MiB materialized replacement, and at most 64 MiB
of canonical bytes (128 MiB total), plus the ordinary inflight-call slot. The
inflight slot transfers into queued/worker ownership; the preprocessing
reservation remains held until the owned payload digest exists, then releases.
The private profile permits two such envelopes root-wide (256 MiB total), the
minimum overlap that lets one provisional caller wait while another establishes
the authority it must later revalidate. A third concurrent preprocessor fails
before allocating or invoking Lance with typed resource
`stream_b2_preprocessing_bytes`; this bound is process memory admission, not a
retained-storage quota.

A graph-internal Lance dataset, `_stream_tokens.lance`, is the
sole **post-fold** per-key sequencing authority. It is initialized by the new
format strand and addressed only through the exact version selected by
`__manifest`, never by its raw Lance HEAD. The token pointer's durable witness
is main-branch version plus Lance transaction UUID. Its shared
`CurrentHeadWitness.manifest_e_tag` slot is canonically `None`: local object
stores derive ETags partly from the inode, so copying an otherwise exact graph
changes that provider-local value. Strict transactions and recovery still
fence every token effect; a provider-local ETag is not graph identity. Its
current row is keyed by
`(stable_table_id, incarnation_id, logical_id)` and carries the immutable
`origin_enrollment_id` under which that token became current, stream
incarnation, current stream token, write ID, predecessor token,
`PRESENT | WITHDRAWN` disposition, contributor, payload digest, exact tagged
origin, and terminal correction actor/operation when present. F5's next format
extends the disposition with `DEAD_LETTERED` plus versioned terminal
object/reason/candidate evidence; it does not add another row origin. Older
formats reject the new disposition/evidence. A token row is
current protocol state, not an admission log; there is at most one current row
per logical graph key. Phase-D physical rebind does not rewrite every token row:
responses report the separately revalidated current binding, while
`origin_enrollment_id` remains attribution history. A token-authority reset
instead mints a new stream incarnation.

This internal table is not a competing authority:

- before fold, the metadata embedded in the durable MemWAL row plus the
  existing B1 worker cut is authoritative;
- after fold, the manifest-selected token-table version is authoritative;
- a normal fold or correction stages the base-table and token-table effects in
  one RFC-022 recovery envelope and exposes both in one `__manifest` CAS;
- there is no per-ack token-table commit and no independently writable token
  path; and
- for `PRESENT`, the winning base row's hidden metadata must agree with its
  token row. A mismatch is uncovered corruption and fails closed, but the base
  copy is evidence/attribution rather than a second sequencing source.

The token table is necessary for explicit `WITHDRAW`: an acknowledged write
can become terminal while the graph key remains absent or its prior visible
value remains unchanged. A hidden field on the visible base row cannot
represent that state. A current `WITHDRAWN` token is never aged out by GC; it
remains current until a later accepted change explicitly names that full token
as predecessor. The successor then preserves it in the hash chain. Thus an old
retry never becomes admissible merely because its terminal disposition aged
out, while the table still keeps only one current row per graph key.

That durability creates a format obligation. Any format that can make a
non-`PRESENT` token current must also contain a same-format safe rebuild exit
before that state becomes reachable. A later strict-strand binary cannot supply
the exit because it refuses to open the older root. V11 therefore owns
irreversible retirement/export for `WITHDRAWN`; F5 extends that operation for
`DEAD_LETTERED` before activating the later disposition.

Admission keeps B1's `charge -> shared admission -> same-key input queue ->
worker mode` order. Under that order, it derives the current token from the
manifest-selected token table and overlays only watcher-confirmed rows already
in the one live generation. That overlay is a warm derived projection: it is
updated only after watcher success, discarded on ambiguity/retirement, and
never treated as restart authority. Reopen with possible residue remains
fold-only, so a new put cannot race an unclassified token. Repeated IDs inside
one caller request are evaluated in caller order, but one physical Lance put
contains at most one fresh occurrence per logical key. A later occurrence waits
for the prior run's watcher and is then reclassified against its confirmed
overlay; an exact duplicate becomes `already_durable`, while a successor must
have obtained and named the confirmed token in a later request. The adapter
never treats an opaque pending candidate as caller authority.

Exact token/base probes stream their result rather than collecting all batches.
They stop after requested-key-count plus one row, reject duplicates/foreign
keys, bound each Arrow emission, and charge retained current-authority maps
against the same fixed 32-MiB token-projection ceiling. Separately valid large
historical authorities therefore fail loudly in aggregate instead of making a
later small generation allocate memory proportional to prior per-key maxima.

The initial schema/lifecycle/HEAD capture used to select the admission domain
is explicitly provisional. A caller may wait behind an exclusive fold after
that capture. Once it owns shared admission and the same-key queue, the
implemented adapter re-lists relevant recovery and recaptures the accepted
schema, stable binding, lifecycle revision, current HEAD witness, stream
incarnation, and manifest-selected token witness before token classification or
`put_no_wait`. Any movement returns an effect-free typed conflict/retry. A stale
provisional capture can locate a gate; it can never authorize a WAL effect.

The overlay also mints a compact fold certificate for each same-key chain. The
first row for a key in one generation stores the manifest-selected current
token as `fold_base_token` and depth 1; every later admitted row inherits that
base and increments the depth. Lance's LSM scanner may collapse `P -> X -> Y`
to winner `Y` before fold, so the winning row must still prove that its admitted
chain started at manifest token `P`. Fold compares the winner's stream
incarnation and fold base to the manifest-selected token row, recomputes its
candidate token, validates the nonzero bounded depth, and fails closed on a
mismatch. It neither infers the chain from LWW order nor permanently retains
superseded `X`. These reserved fields are trusted engine metadata under the same
no-raw-writer support boundary as contributor attribution.

For each row, the engine first verifies the stream incarnation, normalizes the
payload, derives the candidate `stream_token`, and classifies the occurrence
**before** minting a new `Admission` origin or fold certificate. Candidate
equality compares only token-bound preimage fields; persisted origin and
certificate belong to the already-current row and are returned rather than
recreated. The rules are:

1. if `(write_id, predecessor_token)` equals that pair on the current token row
   but contributor or payload digest differs, the result is terminal
   `StreamIdempotencyConflict`;
2. if the candidate token equals the current token, every token-bound preimage
   field must match. A hash-equal field mismatch is corruption. For current
   `PRESENT`, the persisted base hidden metadata must agree with the token row
   and the result is `already_durable` with its persisted origin/certificate.
   For current `WITHDRAWN`, the token row must agree with its terminal correction
   receipt/origin; the base row is deliberately allowed to be absent or carry
   the older visible value and is not compared as a current-token copy. The
   result is the terminal `withdrawn` disposition. Neither case mints an origin,
   certificate, or `put_no_wait`;
3. otherwise `predecessor_token` must equal the complete current token,
   including null-to-null. A mismatch is an effect-free
   `StreamSequenceConflict` that returns the current token; and
4. only the remaining case may call Lance; watcher success advances the warm
   overlay to the candidate token.

The accepted chain is therefore `P -> X -> Y`, where each letter denotes the
full opaque token rather than only its caller UUID. If `X` returns `AckUnknown`,
recovery first makes its possible residue fold-only. A later exact retry sees
either `P` and may write `X`, `X` and returns `already_durable`, or a newer `Y`
and returns `StreamSequenceConflict` without calling Lance. The unsafe
`X(unknown) -> Y(durable) -> retry X` overwrite is no longer representable.
Two concurrent `X(P)` and `Y(P)` calls serialize: one wins and the other
conflicts; `Y` is accepted after `X` only when it explicitly names `X`.

No automatic retry follows invocation. `AckUnknown` carries its
`admission_attempt_id`, caller ordinal range, binding, and logical write IDs but
makes no durability claim. It may include the deterministic candidate stream
token but must label it unconfirmed; generic stream status never resolves that
attempt.
A later explicit retry may report the exact write current or return a
current-token sequence conflict; neither result retroactively claims whether
the earlier physical attempt was durable.

### 4.2 Attribution and audit boundary

The authenticated `contributor_id` is resolved at the trusted engine boundary
after Cedar authorization. Only attempts to supply the reserved
`$stream.contributor_id` or `$stream.origin` metadata are rejected; a logical
schema property that happens to be named `contributor_id` remains ordinary user
data. The HTTP bearer principal, embedded SDK actor, and remote CLI actor all
reach the same engine method. Because contributor identity participates in the
token, an exact retry is actor-bound: retrying the same write tuple after an
actor change returns `StreamIdempotencyConflict` rather than impersonating the
original contributor. The contributor is embedded before `put_no_wait`, so a
durable row cannot become an unattributed fold winner after restart.

The fold's graph commit is authored by the system actor
`omnigraph:stream-fold`. In the experimental cluster profile an automatic
fold's recovery/lineage payload also binds the durable P1 `FoldDelegation`
identity and profile revision; an explicit operator fold retains its
authenticated management actor/operation in the management receipt. The fixed
recovery/lineage payload carries a sorted
visible-contributor count, visible-write count, and SHA-256 digest over the
sorted winning `(contributor_id, stream_token, write_id, tagged_origin)`
tuples. Recovery publishes that pre-bound summary rather than
recomputing a possibly different one. Exact winning attribution remains on the
base row and in the current token row. A `WITHDRAWN` token additionally records
the authenticated correction actor and operation.

B2's minimum audit contract is intentionally about graph-visible winners and
current terminal withdrawals. An acknowledged row that a later caller
explicitly supersedes through the predecessor chain is not a permanent graph
commit and is not promised an unbounded per-attempt audit record after WAL
reclamation. If permanent audit of every acknowledged-but-superseded attempt
becomes a product requirement, it needs a separate retention/cost decision and
an internal Lance participant; it must not appear as per-attempt manifest rows,
sidecars, or a custom log in this RFC.

### 4.3 Persistent lifecycle and operator authority

B2 retains `OPEN | DRAINING | SEALED` but upgrades the stream-state payload to
protocol v2. `DRAINING` is a durable operation, not an in-memory observation.
Every state-v2 row carries a strictly monotonic `lifecycle_revision`; every
successful publication of that row increments it exactly once, including a
publication that changes only a witness, retention summary, or last-fold
summary. The lifecycle row itself is lifetime-bounded: it retains only current
receipt IDs plus a fixed-size `{head_record_id, record_count, chain_digest}`
commitment for each enrollment/binding, management, and effectful-claim
sequence. Internal v11 makes `current_binding_receipt_id` and
`current_claim_receipt_id` explicitly relative to the current binding scope;
rebind advances those bounded references without rewriting or discarding an
old record.

The already manifest-selected graph-global `_stream_tokens.lance` participant
is also the stream control-receipt ledger. V11 adds tagged, immutable,
individually bounded `EnrollmentReceiptV2`, `BindingReceipt`,
`ManagementReceipt`, `ProfileManagementReceipt`, `ClaimAttemptEffect`, and
`ClaimReceipt` rows alongside current-token, correction-receipt, and
`AuthorityRetirementReceipt` rows.
Later format strands add their own tags rather than reinterpreting these.
V11 assigns current-token and control-ledger rows disjoint trusted row tags and
canonical key domains. Current-token probes constrain the token tag and token
lookup key; receipt probes constrain one ledger tag. A receipt row can neither
collide with nor materialize as a logical current-token row.
Every ledger row has one versioned canonical `record_lookup_key` and a common
chain envelope containing its scope/tag, contiguous ordinal, predecessor record
ID, prior chain digest, and resulting chain digest. The lookup key has one
scalar index; the protocol assumes neither a compound nor an ordered Lance
index. Exact idempotency lookup materializes at most the requested row plus one
under the manifest-selected ledger version. Receipt-first lookup remains
internal idempotency/recovery authority, including the shipped scope-global
operation-ID semantics; this refactor does not reinterpret persisted lookup
keys or canonical request digests. EXP exposes no receipt-history pagination
or audit-history cursor. Neither the ordinary manifest snapshot nor a hot
lifecycle/profile CAS performs an application-level fold over or decodes
ledger history.

Lance scalar-index coverage is derived state, not a logical precondition.
Appending a ledger fragment leaves that fragment outside an older index until
`optimize_indices` incorporates it, and correct queries scan that uncovered
tail. Recovery-v14 reserves a fail-closed
`StreamTokenLedgerIndexMaintenance` scaffold whose payload meaning is frozen;
a different final grammar requires a new strand. Logical EXP activation does
not require the reconciler. If accepted production evidence later schedules
one, a manifest-derived reconciler runs under
the graph-global recovery barrier and root token gate, applies the existing
Optimize-style exact-effect classification and auto-cleanup stripping, and
advances only the manifest-selected `_stream_tokens` pointer to a
content-identical version with extended index coverage without weakening B2a
retain-all. It never changes a current token row, receipt chain, or logical
operation result. A late or failed reconciliation leaves lookup
correct and reports uncovered-fragment count, the honest oldest-age availability
state, and its error; it cannot make
a lifecycle operation fail because a physical index is stale. Ordinary graph
`optimize` does not maintain `_stream_tokens`. F6b3's failpoints-only
instrument now measures exact-selected uncovered coverage plus current-token
hit/miss and cluster-only terminal-page scans locally and on RustFS/S3. The
fixture holds the logical token result and terminal-page cardinality fixed, not
the page's serialized bytes: immutable receipt history continues to change
selected-version metadata. Fresh-handle operations are not cold graph opens or
cold-provider-cache measurements, and coverage is sampled outside their timed
windows. The F6b3 instrument does not synthesize a covered token HEAD. F6b7
adds a distinct failpoints-only paired cut: after proving raw HEAD equals
manifest selection and excluding token writers, it accepts only the named
lookup index's content-identical `CreateIndex` successor, selects that exact
witness, and compares current-token plus profile-receipt hit/miss work while
charging its table/manifest maintenance I/O. It owns no recovery sidecar and is
not the production reconciler or scheduling threshold. Status exposes uncovered
count when Lance provides exact coverage and explicitly marks oldest age
unavailable because this cut has no exact fragment-creation timestamp. Until an
accepted production decision says otherwise, uncovered-tail work is an explicit
invariant-15 EXP gap. Thus “bounded result
materialization” never masquerades as a claim that a partially covered index
performs zero physical scanning.

Every v11 profile-management operation first pre-mints the exact ledger
transaction in its v13 `StreamProfileChange` sidecar. Lifecycle, claim,
correction, maintenance, retirement, and later F5 ledger tags use their
separately selected strand's matching recovery envelope and do not reinterpret
v13. The sole graph-manifest CAS that makes a terminal receipt
authoritative advances the `_stream_tokens` pointer together with the bounded
lifecycle/profile row and its chain commitment. A classified nonterminal claim
attempt may checkpoint its immutable attempt row with an earlier pointer-only
manifest CAS while the same sidecar remains authoritative; the sidecar then
carries only that committed chain head/count plus at most one current attempt
plan. It never accumulates an inline vector. A crash before either CAS leaves
the new ledger version unselected and recovery-owned; a selected pointer
without the exact bounded current reference/sidecar state is corruption.
`protocol_v13` therefore includes only `StreamProfileChange` and its exact
receipt transaction/pointer facts. Recovery-v14 carries the equivalent facts
for lifecycle-v3 enrollment, claim, fold, and terminal-quiesce transitions;
its later reserved variants remain fail-closed rather than treating any of
those effects as manifest-only.
B2a never deletes or compacts these selected immutable ledger records, so
aggregate retained storage remains unbounded without making hot authority
state or operation memory grow with lifetime.

The complete lifecycle row additionally carries:

`OPEN` has no drain, block, or sealed proof. `DRAINING` has exactly one drain
and at most one exact strict block. `SEALED` has one exact empty proof and no
strict block. Every transition compares the complete prior lifecycle row; no
optional serde default reinterprets a v8 row. Lifecycle-only CASes are audited
metadata changes and do not move graph lineage.

Claim-epoch ordering is scoped by `(binding_scope_id, enrollment_id, shard_id)`.
Within one scope the retained receipts are strictly increasing and the current
receipt is the greatest achieved epoch in that scope. The lifecycle's current
receipt and any `SealedProof` must name its current binding scope. Receipts and
binding receipts from older scopes remain immutable retained history, but their
numeric epochs are neither compared with the new scope nor accepted as proof
for its sentinels. A fresh rebind may therefore start at the substrate's
initial epoch without invalidating a larger epoch retained from an old shard.
Initial enrollment appends the first ledger `BindingReceipt`, mirroring the
immutable legacy `EnrollmentReceipt`. In v11 the current physical enrollment,
binding, and shard set derive only from `current_binding_receipt_id` plus the
matching bounded chain head; the original receipt is provenance, not current
authority after rebind. Rebind appends one fresh immutable ledger receipt and
the sole manifest CAS atomically moves that pointer and chain commitment
without rewriting history.

Every externally initiated lane-scoped mutating management request **after
enrollment** is compare-and-set, not "act on whatever is current." It carries a
non-nil operation ID, the expected `lifecycle_revision`, and, when it addresses
a drain or block, the expected `drain_id` or `block_token`. Quiesce uses its
`drain_id` as the operation ID; explicit fold uses `fold_operation_id`;
resume/abort-drain uses `resume_id`; data correction uses `correction_id`;
authority correction uses `authority_correction_id`; rebind uses `rebind_id`.
Its idempotency occurrence is `(stream incarnation, operation kind, operation
ID)`, and the expected revision is part of its canonical request digest.

Root-wide authority retirement is the explicit exception. It carries
`retirement_id`, expected `profile_revision`, and the exact plan digest; its
occurrence is `(graph identity, AUTHORITY_RETIREMENT, retirement_id)`. Before
checking the relevant expected revision for a new operation, the engine
performs the bounded indexed operation-kind-appropriate
`ManagementReceipt`/`AuthorityRetirementReceipt` ledger lookup at the
manifest-selected token version, then checks exact in-progress authority. A
terminal same occurrence and canonical request digest returns the recorded
result. An in-progress `DrainDescriptor` or relevant sidecar with the same
operation ID, digest, and original expected revision resumes that exact plan
even though its lifecycle or profile revision has advanced. The same occurrence
with another digest is `StreamIdempotencyConflict` at either retained
authority. Only with no retained occurrence does a revision or addressed-
authority mismatch return effect-free `StreamLifecycleChanged` or
`StreamRetirementPlanChanged`; it never retargets the call.
Each terminal successful state-changing request records its kind, canonical
digest, from/to revision, actor, complete bounded canonical result payload, and
result digest as one immutable ledger row. For hidden quiesce, its recovery-v14
ledger transaction and sole terminal manifest CAS advance the selected ledger
pointer, lifecycle row, and bounded management-chain commitment together. A
multi-publication quiesce is
not complete at `OPEN -> DRAINING`: its `DrainDescriptor` plus recovery
sidecars are in-progress authority, same-ID retry resumes that exact plan, and
its terminal management receipt appears only with `SEALED` (or an explicit
durable terminal failure). Internal continuations use the persisted operation
identity, request digest, and exact current revision rather than minting a new
caller operation. Enrollment is the one no-prior-state exception: its CAS
token is the exact declared-schema identity/configuration witness plus
`enrollment_request_id`, and its separate immutable ledger
`EnrollmentReceiptV2` supplies the same lost-result guarantee.

Each ledger receipt remains individually bounded by its versioned schema and
the row/memory limits of the transaction that stores it. B2a retains every
selected record for the stream incarnation without aggregate capacity
preflight, eviction, or a hot-row vector. A new root/stream incarnation makes
an old request a binding mismatch. Thus a delayed retry from an earlier
drain/resume cycle can only return its indexed receipt or a stale-revision
error; it can never begin a later cycle. Physical history growth is an
accepted storage cost, not an admission signal or a cost paid by every state
read.

A claim sidecar may be removed without a receipt only after exact no-effect
classification. Once a claim creates a manifest/sentinel authority effect, the
sidecar remains until its pre-minted ledger transaction appends the terminal
`ClaimReceipt` and the same lifecycle CAS that adopts the achieved epoch
advances the ledger pointer, claim-chain commitment, and
`current_claim_receipt_id`. If the row is `DRAINING`, that CAS advances both
the top-level epoch floor and mutable `drain.target_epoch_floor_by_shard` to
the exact achieved epoch; it never leaves the target below current authority.
`drain.operation_request_payload` remains the complete immutable canonical
preimage so recovery can always reconstruct the original management-request
commitment even after a fold advances the current HEAD or disable adoption
retargets the current goal. The same
claim ID with another
`claim_operation_digest` conflicts; after terminal publication, another
`terminal_effect_digest` conflicts. `claim_operation_digest` is immutable
across recovery attempts and is canonical over the logical lifecycle
operation, claim kind/profile, exact binding-scope/enrollment/shard identity,
invariant initial authority, and contract versions. Each caller-visible claim
invocation has a fresh
`attempt_id` and an `attempt_plan_digest` over its authenticated authority
prestate/tail, permitted intermediates, and planned sentinel. B2b additionally
binds its storage envelope. Reusing an attempt ID with another plan or terminal
effect digest conflicts.

The claim's attempt sequence is an immutable ledger chain, not an inline
`attempt_effect_chain`. Before each Lance invocation, recovery-v14
`StreamClaim` durably replaces the
sidecar's one bounded current-attempt plan; after exact classification,
recovery appends one `ClaimAttemptEffect` ledger row whose ordinal,
predecessor ID, prior digest, and resulting digest extend the selected chain.
A pointer-only manifest CAS may checkpoint that row while leaving the sidecar
authoritative. The terminal `ClaimReceipt` binds the final head, count, and
digest. Runtime work in one execution remains bounded and typed; a later
recovery execution resumes from the persisted head instead of loading prior
attempt bodies or resetting identity. B2a imposes no lifetime count/byte cap
on retained ledger records because neither the sidecar nor hot manifest state
grows with that count. A stock-Lance claim or materialization still returns no
substrate receipt. OmniGraph records only the manifest/sentinel facts required
to recover the lifecycle transition; it is not a physical-object inventory
and does not enumerate randomized generation-materialization residue. B2a
retains every selected record indefinitely. B2b may compact older records only
through the authoritative checkpoint protocol in §4.5.2.

`SEALED` is immutable with respect to its current shard retention state. A new
ordinary claim or profile-specific retention operation is refused while
sealed. Recovery-covered `StreamResume` is the only same-binding epoch movement
and consumes the old proof while publishing `OPEN`. The separately integrated
`StreamRebind` may consume that proof and publish a fresh binding scope with its
initial fence-only claim receipt and a new exact proof, but remains `SEALED`
and admits no writer or put; it retains all old binding/claim history, and only
a later resume may open it. Rebuild reads the unchanged current proof.
Retention work must finish while `OPEN` or `DRAINING`, and quiesce resolves
every pending claim plus any B2b reservation/reclaim/checkpoint and its
lifecycle publication before constructing the final proof.

For every `DRAINING` row,
`drain.expected_current_head_witness == current_head_witness` is an invariant.
Every graph-visible drain fold or correction that advances the base table
rewrites both copies atomically; only `drain_id`, goal, initiating actor/time,
expected binding, and guarded operation normally remain stable. The selected
experimental profile has one explicit exception: its metadata-only
`DisableDrainAdoption` may change `OPEN_AFTER_FOLD` to `SEALED` while recording
the exact disable override and terminal receipt through the future lifecycle
recovery strand's
`StreamLifecycleReceipt(kind = DisableDrainAdoption)`; it changes no other
stable field and never reopens. A `SealedProof` carries the final equal witness.
“Preserve the drain” below always means preserve that stable operation identity
and intent, including any disable override, not preserve stale descriptor bytes.

The public state machine is:

```text
OPEN --quiesce or blocked fold--> DRAINING
DRAINING(OPEN_AFTER_FOLD) --DisableDrainAdoption--> DRAINING(SEALED)
DRAINING --exact empty-cut proof--> SEALED
SEALED --StreamRebind recovery--> SEALED   // fresh binding scope and proof
SEALED --StreamResume recovery--> OPEN
DRAINING --abort-drain recovery--> OPEN   // only after the rules below
```

Quiesce requires a caller-minted non-nil `drain_id` and expected lifecycle
revision, acquires the common stream-admission lease exclusively, runs the
recovery barrier, waits for every watcher/retirement owner, and CASes
`OPEN -> DRAINING` before a new physical drain effect. The durable descriptor
is the restart plan. Under it the worker advances the epoch through the
selected retention profile's claim hook, classifies and folds each exact cut
through recovery-v14 `StreamDrainFold`, independently proves no
active/frozen/replay tail plus shard/base merge agreement, then CASes
`DRAINING -> SEALED` with the exact proof. It never holds a table queue while
waiting for a fold that needs that queue. The management-receipt rules above
make the exact operation retry-safe and reject a stale request instead of
retargeting it. Restart continues `DRAINING` and never auto-opens it.
A retry may reuse only a confirmed claim bound to that same `drain_id` whose
achieved epoch satisfies the descriptor's target floor. The pre-drain `OPEN`
writer's current receipt never supplies the fence: a new drain claims strictly
above that floor before it may prove emptiness. If recovery needs a
still-higher claim, its receipt-adoption CAS advances both the entry and drain
target floors atomically before proof construction.

The terminal seal uses recovery-v14
`StreamLifecycleReceipt(kind = QuiesceFinalize)`. Together with the adoption
subkind above, this is the ledger-plus-manifest recovery owner for the two
metadata-only lifecycle transitions. Before any receipt-ledger effect it fixes
the subkind, operation/request digest, exact profile and lifecycle prestate,
pre-minted ledger transaction, target lifecycle row and receipt-chain
commitment, and selected token-pointer outcome. Recovery classifies that exact
transaction and permits only the one matching manifest CAS; an unselected
receipt version is inert. It does not absorb resume/abort, folds, corrections,
or another already-discriminated sidecar family.

Every B2 epoch advance—cold open, quiesce, and resume/abort—uses a
profile-neutral claim contract. Before writer open, existing manifest/recovery
authority must durably bind the claim operation, exact authoritative prestate,
the prior authenticated WAL-tail endpoint/commitment, the bounded new tail
segment, every permitted authority intermediate, and exact terminal
classification. B2b additionally binds its physical-growth envelope. Unknown
authoritative tail, collision, overflow, a foreign effect, or ambiguous
authority movement fails closed.
Claims preserve the prior `replay_after_wal_entry_position`, replay/classify
every object after it, and may advance it only through the existing
flush/coverage proof. The open/admission barrier resolves or refuses every
pending claim before another claim or put.
If recovery must invoke a higher-epoch claim, it first stores that invocation's
fresh `attempt_id`, `attempt_plan_digest`, exact authority prestate, permitted
effect states, and prior ledger-chain head in the sidecar's one bounded
current-attempt slot, and only then calls Lance. The immutable
`claim_operation_digest` does not change. After classification it appends the
immutable attempt ledger row before replacing that slot or finalizing. Runtime
invocation retries obey a bounded policy; exhaustion returns typed
`RecoveryRequired` and keeps the sidecar, but a later recovery does not reload
or copy the historical attempt bodies. Finalization writes one individually
bounded `ClaimReceipt` containing only the terminal facts and attempt-chain
head/count/digest. B2a neither reserves nor meters physical storage for those
invocations.

Each terminal claim also advances an authenticated WAL-tail segment chain.
Starting at the prior receipt's exact tail endpoint, recovery streams and
classifies only the newly reachable contiguous entries through the achieved
sentinel. That delta is bounded by the one no-roll generation contract. The
latest manifest-selected `LastFoldSummary(outcome = PUBLISHED)` cut, when it
lies inside that delta, supplies the candidate boundary between rows already
represented by current base/token authority and the still-active suffix. Claim
preparation fixes that boundary in its recovery operation, and the terminal
`ClaimReceipt` persists it as
`authenticated_tail_published_prefix_position`; recovery requires exact
agreement. Later empty-cut proof uses that receipt-owned position and never
reclassifies from a replaceable `LastFoldSummary`. For each key, the folded
prefix must chain internally and terminate at the exact current token;
the first active occurrence must then start a fresh depth-one chain from that
same current token/base authority. The physical Lance replay cursor may also
advance for an unmerged flushed generation, so it is only an upper-bound
witness and never selects folded-prefix semantics by itself.
new `ClaimReceipt` records its entry count, endpoint, domain-separated segment
digest, prior chain digest, resulting cumulative chain digest, and streaming
LWW projection commitment. Immutable WAL objects plus the manifest-selected
receipt ledger make the old prefix tamper-evident without rereading it. A gap,
overlap, foreign entry, malformed sentinel, data beyond the claimed covered
cut, or endpoint disagreement is fail-closed. A claim-only or empty-lane cycle
commits a bounded control-only delta, so another claim never restarts at
genesis. Later claims and `SealedProof` validate only their bounded delta from
the selected head and bind the cumulative commitment; they never rescan all
historical sentinels.

In the schema above, `authenticated_tail_prior_position` and
`authenticated_tail_position` are the exact lower and upper endpoints,
`authenticated_tail_published_prefix_position` is the exact receipt-owned
published-prefix endpoint or zero when the segment has none,
`authenticated_tail_segment_entry_count` and
`authenticated_tail_segment_digest` describe only this bounded delta, and
`authenticated_tail_segment_lww_projection_digest` commits its active suffix,
while
`authenticated_tail_prior_chain_digest` plus
`authenticated_tail_chain_digest` authenticate the transition.
`authenticated_tail_segment_count` is the cumulative number of committed
segments, not the entry count of this segment. The stream-incarnation,
configuration, physical-binding, and decoded empty-fence-state commitments
make those validation inputs explicit rather than implicit in the generic
receipt-history chain.

Claims are the sole owner of this segment chain. Their recovery-v14 ledger transaction
and lifecycle CAS advance the selected token pointer and bounded tail
commitment but write no base row or current-token row. An ordinary fold does
not append a segment receipt. Recovery-v14 `StreamFoldV2` carries the expanded
lifecycle, preserves its claim/tail commitments exactly, and owns only the
ordinary exact base+token effects. Its distinct drain-fold variant additionally binds the
current `ClaimReceipt`, recomputes its streaming LWW projection through
`LsmScanner::without_base_table`, and byte-compares the winner/token plan
before publishing. A strict block may follow a successfully authenticated
claim: it leaves that tail commitment in place but advances no
merge/base/current-token authority, so it cannot produce `SEALED`.

The two retention profiles supply that hook differently. The selected B2a
retain-all implementation may consume stock RC.1's manifest-first,
sentinel-second claim only when an existing RFC-022 recovery sidecar, armed
before invocation, can classify and finish the exact no-effect, manifest-only,
manifest-plus-sentinel terminal, and lost-result authority states under the
single-live-writer boundary. The sidecar—not the stock shard manifest—binds the
planned successor sentinel position/digest. An unclassifiable authority gap is
`RecoveryRequired`; it is never papered over by path inference. Unreferenced
randomized generation output is not shard authority: B2a retains it forever
and never adopts it, but does not require an attempt receipt or storage charge
for it.

B2b instead uses the patched Lance claim-attempt/terminal-receipt envelope in
§4.5.2: Lance conditionally creates the successor sentinel at checked
`max_authenticated_position + 1`, then names it in the exact shard manifest
that advances the epoch. Only that manifest-named claim may replay. B2b's sole
cursor exception is the reclamation successor: only after a quiescent whole-cut
proof establishes no data-bearing tail may its manifest advance the cursor to
the new sentinel. Claim IDs and individually bounded terminal receipts are common durable
state. For B2a, the OmniGraph graph-manifest-authoritative `ClaimReceipt` is the
durable projection of the already exactly classified RFC-022 sidecar proof for
stock RC.1's manifest-first/sentinel-second effects; only then may the sidecar
be finalized. For B2b it projects and binds the patched Lance terminal receipt
and manifest-named sentinel. Reclaim/checkpoint IDs, retry horizons, and history
compaction are B2b-only.

Drain mode is not the implemented B1 `OPEN` fold with a relaxed check. Its
sidecar binds the complete expected `DRAINING` row and `drain_id`; publication
preserves the drain identity/intent while advancing the base pointer, both
equal `CurrentHeadWitness` copies, epoch floor, token pointer, merged cut, and
durable `LastFoldSummary`. A different drain or `OPEN`/`SEALED` row is a
read-set conflict. A permanent validation failure attaches `StrictBlock` to
that same descriptor without changing its goal and writes
`LastFoldSummary(outcome = STRICT_BLOCKED, graph_commit_id = null)` with the
exact operation, cut, input rows/bytes, zero visible rows/bytes, and time in the
same lifecycle CAS.

Resume and abort-drain use the complete recovery-v15 `StreamResume` payload.
The three-field recovery-v14 scaffold remains frozen and fail-closed;
recovery-v13 remains `StreamProfileChange`-only. `StreamResume`'s `Armed` form binds the complete expected lifecycle
row and revision, caller `resume_id`, canonical request digest, binding,
configuration, base witness, graph-branch topology, fixed actor/operation, an
`OPEN` plan, minimum next epoch floor, and exact `ENABLED` profile/delegation
authority. The current hidden seam acquires the graph-profile gate shared
before the table gate and holds it through claim, terminal ledger effect, and
manifest publication; F7's production wrapper must additionally require
matching checked serving-runtime authority before invocation. The exact
achieved epoch is unknowable before the writer claim. After claiming, the
adapter durably records the exact classified sentinel/epoch and one ledger
transaction containing the terminal `ClaimReceipt` and `ManagementReceipt`,
plus the final `OPEN` row; only that row may publish. B2b's achieved
manifest names the sentinel directly; B2a's stock manifest does not, so its
persisted receipt carries the sidecar's already-classified binding. Recovery
never compensates an epoch or fence sentinel: while admission remains closed it
may follow the pre-authorized rule above to claim a still-higher epoch, then
records a new exact confirmation before publication. An already-visible
byte-identical `OPEN` row finalizes the
sidecar; a divergent `OPEN` row, binding, witness, topology, or uncovered
residue fails closed.

Plain resume accepts only `SEALED`, revalidates schema/PK/config/format, exact
physical binding, sealed proof, and the bounded no-named-graph-branch topology.
Abort-drain is explicit and accepts only `DRAINING`; both calls require a
caller-minted `resume_id` and expected lifecycle revision. Abort additionally requires
that no guarded operation began, the binding and complete current DRAINING row
(including its equal current witnesses) still match, every background
seal/abort owner settled, and no unmerged or strict-blocked cut remains. It may
follow graph-visible folds already completed by the drain, but never reopens
around their residue. A named branch created after quiesce leaves resume safely
`SEALED`.
`DISABLING`, `DISABLED`, and `RETIRED` refuse both operations before a claim.
The profile
writer's exclusive gate therefore either waits for a complete `OPEN`
publication and includes it in the disable drain, or publishes `DISABLING`
first and makes resume effect-free.

Abort is therefore not a skip-invalid escape. If acknowledged residue or a
strict block remains, the only forward paths are retry fold, exact
`DataBlock` correction, or—after its separate future strand—exact
reason-gated `AuthorityBlock` correction;
after residue is graph-visible and the block is cleared, an otherwise eligible
unguarded drain may abort. A quiesce that keeps `goal = SEALED` may instead
continue to the sealed proof. This rule is identical in §8 and the B2 gates.

The full B2 status contract starts from one bounded current lifecycle row and
its manifest-selected ledger references plus a bounded cut-consistent physical
observation. It reports only current receipt identifiers and summaries; no
public receipt-history scan or pagination contract is exposed. The embedded API
continues to expose only the manifest projection through
`Omnigraph::stream_status`; it takes no admission lease and reads no physical
shard witness. F6b6 implements the checked read-only operational core described
below behind an engine-internal seam. F7b leaves that embedded public method
unchanged and exposes only a graph-redacted projection of the checked cut at
`GET /graphs/{graph_id}/stream/status`, in OpenAPI, and through the remote
`stream status` CLI. Direct-SDK checked status remains inactive.

In the supported full B2 profile, status first proves the expensive immutable
token/base and lifecycle-ledger evidence against one manifest-selected cut
without blocking writers. It then takes stream admission exclusively,
read-only lists/classifies all pending recovery intents, settles every writer/
watcher/flush/retirement owner plus every selected-profile claim owner to the
short authority-cut deadline, proves the preflight cut is still selected,
reads the authoritative shard witness, and rereads only mutable authorities
before release. It never resolves recovery.
Movement returns typed `StatusChanged`; failure to settle returns typed
`StatusBusy`. It reports lifecycle/binding/configuration,
`lifecycle_revision`, authoritative and observed epoch, drain ID/goal/phase,
pending generation rows/bytes, replay and merge cut, strict block
token/code/revision, current receipt identifiers/summaries, token-ledger
covered/uncovered-fragment count and the explicit oldest-age availability state, the persisted
`LastFoldSummary`, every pending recovery operation inside the accepted bounded
inventory, and exact rebuild-readiness reasons. A reconciliation error is reported only after measured evidence has
caused a reconciler to be implemented and scheduled.
F6b6 reports pending-generation accounting as exact only from a resident
admit/fold owner or a verified-empty `SEALED` proof. If the only honest route
is cold replay, it reports
`UnavailableColdReplay`; status never advances a Lance cursor or claims a
writer to manufacture the number. A flushed LWW projection is
`UnavailableFlushed` rather than reconstructed as exact. Likewise, the current
Lance cut exposes fragment coverage but no exact fragment-creation timestamp,
so a nonempty
uncovered tail reports oldest age as explicitly unavailable rather than
guessing from unrelated commit time. `DISABLING` requires the explicit checked
cluster-apply status owner. Every pending recovery sidecar inside the accepted
status envelope is included and blocks rebuild. The envelope permits 256
matching direct `.json` sidecars, 256 irrelevant direct-or-nested objects
encountered below the prefix, 4 MiB of cumulative input-anchored URI bytes
across all encountered objects, 32 MiB per sidecar body, and 32 MiB of
cumulative bodies; exceeding any bound is a typed whole-status refusal. When a
sidecar explains physical HEAD movement, that physical
projection is unavailable rather than `StatusChanged`. The public manifest-
only projection remains available in every mode.
Mutable WAL cursor statistics are labeled hints and
never used as receipts. A listing error, overflow, or unknown classification is
an explicit diagnostic error only when the caller requested advisory retained-
object detail; it is not an admission or lifecycle-authority failure. Advisory
retained bytes are labeled as current-listing observations, never quota or
billing truth. The read-only status call does not mutate lifecycle. Every later
admission independently reruns the recovery, lifecycle, token, row, memory, and
backpressure gates; there is no B2a storage-meter or receipt-capacity preflight.

Rebuild preflight requires `SEALED` and re-runs under closed admission plus
schema/branch/table gates. The sealed proof must still match the exact
base/shard state; no relevant sidecar, active/frozen/replayable authoritative
tail, unmerged generation, unattributed winner, or unresolved token may remain.
Unreferenced retained materialization output is inert and does not block the
proof. Export/cutover re-runs the proof. A prior status response is never an
authority token.

`verified_empty_digest` is domain-separated over the exact binding,
configuration, stream incarnation, base witness, ordered authoritative shard-
manifest/referenced-generation state, replay/merge cursors, the current
receipt-ledger chain reference, cumulative authenticated WAL-tail segment
commitment, and the exact current sentinel. It excludes advisory listings,
unreferenced retained objects, storage-byte estimates, and historical receipt
or sentinel bodies. A sentinel may remain beyond the authoritative replay
cursor only when its position/digest/epoch belongs to the immutable prefix
committed incrementally by the manifest-selected claim-receipt chain. B2a uses
the current ledger head plus stock-manifest endpoint; B2b uses its retention
checkpoint plus the current retained claim/manifest successor commitment.
Exactly one sentinel for the achieved current epoch must be present in the
bounded suffix after the prior authenticated endpoint, be decodable, and be
named by `current_claim_receipt_id`; B2b additionally requires the latest
shard manifest to name it.

Proof construction streams only that bounded suffix, verifies its segment
digest/endpoint against the current receipt, and folds its result into the
already-selected cumulative commitment. It does not list, decode, or hash
older sentinels. Older authenticated sentinels from the same binding scope,
shard, and enrollment are harmless immutable fence history represented by the
commitment until B2b reclamation removes them. Receipts and sentinels from
retained prior binding scopes are history, not current-proof inputs. A gap or
overlap from the committed endpoint, data-bearing entry beyond the covered
cursor, malformed or unauthenticated sentinel, second current sentinel, or
future/foreign epoch fails the proof.

### 4.4 Bounded strict correction and disposition

A permanent fold failure discovered from `OPEN` CASes the lifecycle to
`DRAINING(goal = OPEN_AFTER_FOLD)` with the exact tagged `StrictBlock` while
admission is still exclusively closed. Before validation, the explicit fold
attempt pre-mints a non-nil `failure_drain_id` and fixes the authenticated
`stream_manage` actor, initiation time, binding, and current witness in its
plan. The conditional failure CAS installs that exact engine-minted ID and
actor in the new `DrainDescriptor`; a lost reply or retry reads the persisted
descriptor and never mints a replacement. Caller-minted `drain_id` is required
only for the public quiesce operation. If the fold already belongs to a
durable `DRAINING` operation, including quiesce, the CAS attaches the block to
that complete row without changing its `drain_id` or goal; a quiesce therefore
remains `goal = SEALED`. The same CAS writes the exact
`LastFoldSummary(outcome = STRICT_BLOCKED, graph_commit_id = null)` described
above.

At the F3f boundary, a row/data-validator failure installed `DataBlock` and
followed the bounded correction flow below. Current v19's terminal fold instead
diverts valid data conflicts under P4; only a canonical dead-letter object that
exceeds its selected envelope installs `DataBlock` on that new path.
`AuthorityBlock` is reserved but inactive. In its future strand, a pre-cut
binding, witness, schema, token-authority,
or publication-recheck failure may install it only when the engine can
authenticate and retain its complete bounded expected and observed authority
facts plus every exact proof reference needed by at least one reason-gated
repair. The evidence is independent of the data-validator view.
If the generation cut or an authority fact required by every safe repair is
missing, unreadable, ambiguous, or foreign, the engine returns
`RecoveryRequired` or loud storage corruption and does not mint a repairable
block token from incomplete evidence. A `DataBlock` token hashes its immutable
cut/base/violation/revision; an `AuthorityBlock` token instead hashes the
complete expected lifecycle revision, failure phase, canonical expected and
observed authority, exact proof references, allowed repair classes, and
evidence digest.

The current `DataBlock` shape accepts exactly validator contract v1. Its cut is
valid only when a claim receipt is selected at the claim-chain head,
`replay_cursor` equals the authenticated WAL-tail position, and `writer_epoch`
equals both the current shard epoch floor and the active drain target for that
shard. These are structural manifest-load checks, not facts inferred later by
block inspection. Consequently the early retry path may return a stored block
token without reopening the physical WAL while still relying only on
authenticated claim authority.

A data correction is an operator-authorized management operation carrying the
expected lifecycle revision and keyed by `(block_token, correction_id)`; the
token hashes the immutable cut, base witness, violation, and correction
revision. Its management receipt and correction receipt are published together.
Same operation occurrence plus the same plan is idempotent, the same occurrence
with another digest is a conflict, and a stale revision/block token is
`StreamLifecycleChanged`/`ReadSetChanged` before effect.

The active F3f entry point is deliberately narrow: `cluster stream block
show|correct` requires the declared graph, actor, held cluster state lock,
applied stream authority, and explicit `--confirm-stream-offline`. Both calls
retain the cluster apply lock and stopped-process guard. There is no direct
`--store`, served HTTP, remote SDK, or OpenAPI equivalent.

For `DataBlock`, the retained immutable generation is also the authority for a
bounded correction-planning view. That variant stores the validator-contract
version,
offending-key count, and a canonical digest over sorted entries containing
logical key, current blocked-winner stream token, schema-safe violation code/
field path/group, stable validator-defined violation-instance ID, and allowed
`REPLACE | WITHDRAW` actions. Byte-identical duplicate entries are coalesced;
the remaining entries sort lexicographically by their **complete canonical
entry bytes**, including the action set and instance ID. Each resulting entry
receives a stable zero-based `entry_ordinal`, which is included in the digest.
Multiple distinct violations for one key therefore remain independently
pageable without a tie whose order can flip. It does not store or expose whole
row payloads.

While `DRAINING`, validation emits violations directly into the evidence
collector; it does not first retain a global violation vector. Validator
contract v1 admits the detailed canonical-JSON form only while the
deduplicated view has at most 8,192 entries and its complete ordinal-bearing
canonical records total at most 32 MiB. Crossing either limit is not an error
and cannot leave the drain without a terminal disposition. After validating
every source violation and winner-token reference, the collector switches
deterministically to `CORRECTION_VIEW_OVERFLOW`: one projection entry per
exact current winner `(logical key, blocked-winner token)`, the same marker as
its field/group, a domain-separated stable item ID, and `REPLACE` as the sole
action. The projection is ordered by raw UTF-8 logical-key bytes and then token
bytes. Its authority digest is computed incrementally over domain-separated,
length-framed fields, with the table key framed once for the aggregate; no
expanded JSON aggregate is retained. Its independent bound is the
acknowledged generation's at-most 8,192 exact winner keys plus the
already-enforced input/token byte envelopes; the number of schema constraints
cannot enlarge it. The aggregate deliberately does not offer `WITHDRAW`,
because it no longer retains which independent violation that action would
repair. A replacement is revalidated against the complete pinned validator
before any correction can publish.

Under exclusive admission, the read-only block-
inspection operation lists relevant recovery without resolving it, binds the
complete `DRAINING` row/block/base witness, scans the at-most-8,192-row/32-MiB
logical dense-slice cut, reruns that pinned validator, and requires
count/digest equality. The current v19 binary returns at most 256 entries and
256 MiB of complete serialized page data in canonical order per page, with an opaque
cursor bound to `(block_token, correction_view_digest, lifecycle_revision,
next_ordinal)`, then rereads the complete authority before release. The
complete view remains bounded by the 8,192-entry/32-MiB evidence envelope
above; each page also returns that bound revision.
Movement is `BlockChanged`; missing cut data or digest disagreement is fail-
closed corruption. GC cannot reclaim the generation while the block exists.
This makes the operator's predecessor tokens and action choices recoverable
after a lost fold response or restart without creating another mutable plan
authority.

Future `AuthorityBlock` inspection instead re-resolves its exact recovery/Lance proof
references, reconstructs the bounded expected/observed authority
classification, and requires the same `authority_evidence_digest`. It never
reruns the row validator and calls that output evidence for a pre-cut failure.
A moved fact, missing proof, or digest mismatch is fail-closed corruption, not
permission to widen the repair plan.

The trusted engine—not the caller—computes the versioned, domain-separated
`correction_plan_digest` from the stream incarnation, block token, correction
ID, authenticated actor, accepted schema hash, and canonical ordered action
encoding (including complete normalized replacement bytes). A client may send
an optional expected digest as an equality assertion, but cannot choose the
receipt identity. Replaying an ID as another actor or with any differently
encoded action is therefore a conflict.

Idempotency is durable, not inferred after the block disappears. The
manifest-selected token participant also stores an immutable
`CorrectionReceipt` keyed by `(stream_incarnation_id, block_token,
correction_id)` with plan digest, actor, fixed graph commit/result, and final
lifecycle/token digest. A retry checks that receipt before declaring the block
stale: exact ID/digest returns the recorded result, while the same ID with a
different digest is `StreamIdempotencyConflict`. Receipts are rare operator
records, not per-ack admission history. Their canonical schema and the bounded
correction operation impose a source-derived maximum on each individual
receipt, and the token-table transaction that stores one remains subject to the
ordinary row/memory limits. B2a retains every receipt for the stream
incarnation and indexes it for exact idempotency lookup, but EXP exposes no
public receipt-history pagination. It does not reserve a slot, enforce
aggregate receipt count/bytes, or stop row admission because history has grown.
A correction arms its exact receipt and token effects in recovery before
either can become manifest authority. If the backing store cannot persist that
bounded record, the operation follows normal typed storage/recovery semantics
and admission remains closed around the blocked cut; no row is silently
discarded.

Correction targets only keys whose LWW winner is in that blocked cut; adding a
new key is out of B2. It supports two explicit actions:

- `REPLACE(key, write_id, predecessor_token, complete_row)` supplies one
  complete normalized row. Its predecessor must equal the blocked LWW winner's
  full stream token for that key. The correction actor is trusted attribution,
  and the replacement gets the same versioned payload digest, derived successor
  token, and hidden metadata as a public row, but with tagged
  `Correction { correction_id, plan_ordinal }` origin rather than a fabricated
  admission attempt. It inherits the blocked winner's exact
  `fold_base_token` and stores checked `chain_depth + 1`; it does not reset the
  certificate merely because correction bypasses MemWAL. Public admission caps
  one generation at depth 8,192, and the one terminal correction successor caps
  the certificate at `MAX_STREAM_CHAIN_DEPTH = 8,193`. Overflow or any larger
  value is effect-free refusal.
- `WITHDRAW(key)` terminally dispositions the blocked current write while
  leaving the prior manifest-visible graph value unchanged. It is not a graph
  delete. The token table records that current write as `WITHDRAWN`, including
  the correction actor/operation, so an absent prior graph row cannot make an
  old retry admissible.

V18/recovery-v20 activates `WITHDRAW` only through the checked
stopped/offline DataBlock-correction owner; the frozen recovery-v14 scaffolds
remain insufficient and refused. The distinct v17/recovery-v19
`StreamAuthorityRetirement` exit was activated first, so the format that can
create `WITHDRAWN` authority already has an absence-preserving rebuild exit.
Replacement remains a semantic successor, but it is not that exit.

Unmentioned keys retain the original generation's LWW winner. The correction
does not append another MemWAL generation and does not create a custom side
log. Under exclusive admission it scans the one immutable cut, applies the
bounded overlay in memory, reruns complete fold validation, and enforces the
8,192-row/32-MiB logical dense-slice post-overlay bound. A validation failure creates no sidecar,
base effect, token effect, lifecycle movement, or correction success.

Once valid, recovery-v20 `StreamCorrection` binds the prior complete
`DRAINING` row/block token, selected claim, correction ID/digest, exact
generation cut, one pre-minted base transaction, fixed lineage/attribution,
and one pre-minted token transaction containing the complete resulting
`PRESENT | WITHDRAWN` current-token set plus both immutable correction and
management receipts. The base transaction applies one bounded keyed-upsert
batch with at most one image per resulting `PRESENT` key and marks the original
generation merged; an all-`WITHDRAW` result uses the same exact transaction as
a marker-only base effect. Its current-token projection obeys the ordinary
8,192-row/32-MiB logical plan bound, and the same transaction adds only the two
individually bounded ledger records under the mixed token-plus-ledger byte
envelope. There is no chunk chain and no intermediate receipt-only authority
version.

Only the exact base-then-token outcome can make both pointers, the new base
witness, merged progress, correction lineage, receipts, and lifecycle outcome
visible in one manifest CAS. Recovery rejects token-only, foreign, buried, or
mixed effects; after an exact base effect it may recreate only the pre-minted
combined token effect. Until publication the original generation remains
retained. A post-sidecar cancellation returns `RecoveryRequired` plus the
operation ID, and recovery completes only that exact outcome.

The lifecycle outcome remains `DRAINING`: it clears exactly the matching
`StrictBlock`, preserves `drain_id`, goal, initiating actor, and guarded
operation plus any disable `seal_override`, advances both equal
descriptor/top-level current-HEAD witnesses,
preserves the already-achieved epoch floor, and writes the correction
`LastFoldSummary`. That exact row becomes
the baseline for the next empty-proof or `StreamResume`; correction never
publishes a stale witness and never opens admission.

After correction, a `SEALED` drain goal—including one set by exact
`DisableDrainAdoption`—continues to the empty proof. An unadopted
`OPEN_AFTER_FOLD` goal still uses the `StreamResume` recovery kind through the
explicit `stream resume --abort-drain` operation after all residue is visible;
plain `stream resume` continues to accept only `SEALED`. The fold/correction CAS
never opens admission itself. Skip-invalid, implicit drop, whole-generation
discard, base-row delete, and direct `DRAINING -> OPEN` CAS are forbidden.

An eligible `AuthorityBlock` uses a future finalized
`StreamAuthorityCorrection` recovery owner. It must not reinterpret the frozen
recovery-v14 scaffold. The request carries the block token, caller
operation ID, expected lifecycle revision, and one complete reason-gated
repair-plan digest over the authenticated evidence. It may adopt a
binding/witness only from exact transaction and content proof, create a fresh
binding/base from the manifest-visible base plus an authenticated acknowledged
cut, or replace affected current-token rows by exact expected-old/new
authority. Wildcard adoption, prefix or latest-HEAD inference, ordinary export,
and any plan wider than `allowed_repair_classes` are forbidden. A contradictory
key requires explicit `REPLACE | WITHDRAW`. The lifecycle correction strand
understands only `PRESENT | WITHDRAWN`; the later dead-letter strand must use a
new recovery version to extend this operation before `DEAD_LETTERED` authority
can participate.

`Armed` binds the exact inputs, target namespace, bounded allowed-effect
envelope, pre-minted transaction identities, terminal
`ManagementReceipt(kind = AUTHORITY_CORRECTION)`, and, when token rows change,
the token-store `AuthorityCorrectionReceipt` and its final transaction. It does
not guess an achieved Lance HEAD or serialize a table payload. After the exact
owned effects, `EffectsConfirmed` binds achieved refs, HEAD/fragments/content
digests, fixed lineage/fold attribution, and the complete proposed manifest
delta; only that confirmed state may roll forward.

If a fresh base includes the authenticated acknowledged cut, the same terminal
manifest CAS consumes that cut exactly once: it publishes the graph commit,
fold attribution, exact merged-generation marker, matching token outcomes, and
base/token pointers together. It may neither copy those rows while leaving the
cut replayable nor advance merge progress outside the commit DAG. The CAS also
publishes the exact next `DRAINING` row while preserving any disable
`seal_override`, clears only the matching block, and
appends the immutable terminal management receipt. A retry checks that receipt,
then the exact sidecar, before checking the now-absent block or expected
revision. Exact replay returns the recorded result; the same occurrence with a
different digest conflicts. Old objects remain retained. Full revalidation
then lets the same drain continue to its empty proof; missing or
unauthenticated acknowledged bytes remain loud unrecoverable corruption.

### 4.5 Retention profiles

#### 4.5.1 B2a unbounded retain-all/no-GC profile (selected)

B2a deletes no canonical durable MemWAL object after fold, optimize, cleanup,
restart, correction, quiesce, or `SEALED`. Referenced generations, WAL files,
historical fence sentinels, and unreferenced partial or complete randomized
materialization subtrees all remain in the source root indefinitely. Lance's
local atomic-put implementation may delete only its own losing
`manifest/<version>.binpb.tmp.<uuid>` CAS staging files; they never become
shard authority and are not retained-history objects. The profile intentionally
has no MemWAL file/object/byte limit, retained-storage
ledger, quota, admission watermark, physical-output estimator, storage
reservation, or materialization-attempt receipt requirement. It does not
promise bounded disk/object-store usage or indefinite service under finite
provider capacity.

This changes only the physical-retention contract. Row and memory admission
remain bounded at one no-roll generation of at most 8,192 rows and 32 MiB of
logical dense-slice Arrow data; worker count, queues, deadlines, execution retries, and
fold/correction transaction shapes remain explicitly bounded. Every
acknowledgement still requires watcher durability plus the same-writer fence
check. Every authority-changing effect still uses the existing manifest and
recovery protocols, and unresolved authority ambiguity still blocks progress.
No path, listing result, timestamp, or compatible-looking object may establish
ownership. Unreferenced physical residue is simply inert: shard discovery may
observe its parent-level prefix, but production never descends into or reads
the subtree as a generation, never adopts it, never mutates it, and never
deletes it.

Gate R0's first two findings in §0.2 therefore become accepted operational
limitations rather than activation blockers. Its third finding is closed by
the dense-scanner compaction repair. Current-object inventory remains useful as
an advisory regression instrument, but it is not correctness authority,
provider billing truth, or admission input. A store-capacity failure before a
put is a typed storage refusal; after invocation it follows the existing
`AckUnknown`/recovery classification. Neither case permits data loss or false
acknowledgement. Export/rebuild into another root remains an operator tool, not
a capacity promise or mandatory automatic lifecycle.

#### 4.5.2 B2b managed reclamation: own the missing Lance primitive

The RC.1 audit produces an explicit no-go for physical reclamation through the
stock public surface:

- generic `cleanup_old_versions` ignores `_mem_wal`; the checked-in
  `cleanup_old_versions_does_not_reclaim_mem_wal_objects` guard removes
  ordinary Lance versions while proving the present WAL/generation/
  shard-manifest fixture's object names and bytes unchanged. It does not claim
  orphan classification;
- `DatasetMemWalExt`, `ShardWriter`, and `ShardManifestStore` expose no
  MemWAL GC/delete operation or receipt;
- the MemWAL specification warns that deleting WAL files can weaken writer
  fencing. RC.1 checks epoch authority after a PUT conflict/error but returns
  immediately after a successful atomic PUT. The checked-in
  `mem_wal_deleted_fence_slot_allows_stale_writer_success_on_pinned_lance`
  negative guard decodes and deletes the successor's empty epoch-2 WAL fence
  sentinel and proves the stale predecessor can receive watcher success even
  though an explicit fence check returns `PeerClaimedEpoch`; and
- `FlushedGeneration` carries generation/path but no per-generation WAL range.
  Only the shard-wide replay cursor exists, so a WAL prefix is reclaimable only
  at B2b's quiescent whole-cut boundary. `wal_entry_position_last_seen` is never
  substituted.

Private B1 contains the clean-acknowledgement face of that RC.1 gap at the
OmniGraph adapter boundary. Watcher success remains necessary durability
evidence but is no longer sufficient for `DurableBatchAck`: the same
`ShardWriter` must immediately return `Ok(())` from `check_fenced()`. A typed
fence result, an epoch-read error, owner-task failure, or deadline ambiguity is
post-invocation `AckUnknown`, and the worker retires while its possible durable
residue remains replayable. This containment is deliberately narrower than the
required Lance change. It does not erase stale WAL bytes, make a deleted fence
sentinel safe, protect raw Lance MemWAL callers, provide cross-process
seal/failover, or authorize any `_mem_wal` deletion or public B2b surface.

OmniGraph therefore does not raw-delete `_mem_wal` objects, route them through
`delete_unverified`, or compact shard-manifest history. B2b requires the narrow
Lance-owned primitive below; an upstream proposal remains useful, but its
calendar did not block the completed private OmniGraph-only B2a evidence gate.
Only B2b reclamation remains deferred on that primitive. No B2a work may
impersonate reclamation or delete a canonical durable path.

Stock RC.1 exposes only evidence-level raw object listing plus manifest reads,
not the owned classified inventory below. The required public Lance shape is
an opaque inspect/plan/execute protocol with a durable attempt/receipt, for
example:

```text
inspect_mem_wal_retention(...)
plan_mem_wal_reclaim(reclaim_id, exact_witnesses, graph_approved_cut, budgets)
execute_mem_wal_reclaim(serializable_opaque_plan) -> exact_receipt
classify_mem_wal_reclaim(reclaim_id, plan_digest)
    -> pending | aborted_no_effect(receipt) | complete(receipt)
```

The caller cannot forge object paths. A serializable opaque plan binds a
caller-minted `reclaim_id`, plan digest, shard ID; exact latest manifest
version/epoch/status/spec/current generation/replay cursor/last-seen
hint/ordered generations; exact base dataset version with merged-generation
and index-catchup state; the graph-approved whole cut and exact authoritative
replay cursor; the maximum position across the complete authenticated retained
WAL/sentinel inventory; and object/byte delete budgets. The captured
`current_generation` is monotonic allocation authority, not reclaimable data:
the base must prove every generation through it merged or otherwise exactly
classified, and reclamation never resets or reuses that number.
It classifies referenced generations from the authoritative checkpoint summary
plus complete retained successor chain, never-referenced generation-output
orphans, previously referenced retired generations, WAL positions,
malformed/unknown objects, and exact byte totals. The checkpoint preserves the
ever-referenced/retired versus never-referenced evidence needed after history
compaction. A gapped/bounded-out chain, incomplete summary, or unknown object is
retained and reported, never guessed from age or path shape.

Before pruning, Lance conditionally persists an attempt record containing the
`reclaim_id`, plan digest, exact prestate digest, and the opaque plan bytes. The
record is substrate recovery authority, not an OmniGraph data log. Execution
revalidates every witness byte-for-byte. If pre-sentinel revalidation proves the
plan stale or its conditional authority acquisition loses before the plan has
written its sentinel, changed its manifest, or deleted any object, Lance
conditionally persists an
`aborted_no_effect(receipt)` terminal record. Same ID/digest retry returns that
receipt and a fresh plan must use a fresh ID; another digest for the ID
conflicts. Once any planned physical effect exists, abort is forbidden and
same-plan recovery must complete or fail closed with the pending attempt
retained.
In the supported one-live-writer-process profile, OmniGraph already holds
exclusive admission and has retired every writer. Lance conditionally writes a
decoded-empty successor fence sentinel for `writer_epoch + 1` at a position
equal to checked `max_authenticated_wal_entry_position + 1`, not merely after
the approved data cutoff. Overflow, a gap whose contents were not inventoried,
or an existing object at that exact position refuses before effect. Lance then
appends one exact successor shard manifest with both `version` and
`writer_epoch` incremented, the captured `current_generation` preserved exactly,
an empty complete flushed-generation set, the sentinel position/digest,
`replay_after_wal_entry_position = sentinel_position`, and the exact reclaim
ID/digest. It does not transparently retry around a conflict. A crash after the
sentinel but before the manifest leaves an exact attempt-owned effect that only
same-plan recovery may finish; any other object at that position fails closed.
Only after the successor manifest durably names the new sentinel does execution
delete the planned generation/orphan objects, data WAL prefix through the
captured old cursor, and every separately authenticated older empty sentinel
below the new cursor. Exact inventory proved there was no data-bearing tail in
that interval. The new sentinel is never deleted.

The same ID/digest re-execution recognizes the exact prestate, exact
attempt-owned successor sentinel before CAS, exact successor manifest, or a
durable completed receipt. It may finish the CAS only from the sentinel state
and resumes missing deletes only from the successor-manifest state. A different
digest for the ID, a foreign successor, or an unclassifiable movement fails
closed. Missing planned objects are
idempotently absent; unknown objects remain. Partial deletion leaves
manifest-unreferenced, base-covered residue owned by the persisted attempt. On
completion Lance durably writes the exact receipt before returning; it carries
before/after manifest/epoch, WAL cutoff, new sentinel position/digest, paths,
the inventoried prior maximum position, equal before/after current-generation
authority, deleted/already-absent/residual object and byte counts, and retained/
unknown totals. A lost result is resolved
from the attempt/successor/receipt plus fresh inventory, never optimistic
process memory. Attempt and receipt records remain counted and retained through
the supported idempotency/recovery horizon.

Pending reclaim attempts are part of the mandatory B2b open/admission barrier,
not optional maintenance metadata. Before any stream open, status, put, fold,
quiesce, resume, correction, rebuild preflight, or later reclaim may claim a
writer or touch shard state, it classifies the exact attempt set. Mutating
operations resolve the sole recognized same-plan attempt or refuse; status
reports it without mutation. Patched Lance itself refuses a shard-writer claim
while a pending reclaim attempt exists, so a crash cannot let ordinary reopen
adopt the attempt-owned successor sentinel as foreign WAL. Unknown/multiple
attempts fail closed.

Reclaim and checkpoint may start only from `OPEN` or `DRAINING` under exclusive
admission; `SEALED` refuses them. A dedicated `StreamRetention` recovery
envelope binds the complete expected lifecycle row, exact Lance attempt/plan, and fixed post-
receipt shard epoch/manifest/cursor/inventory outcome before the first physical
effect. After Lance terminals the receipt, the operation records
`EffectsConfirmed` and conditionally publishes the exact epoch floor, shard
witness, retained-byte classes, and lifecycle revision while preserving the
lifecycle state and any drain identity/goal. A separately accepted bounded-root
amendment may add its own graph-history charge; base B2b does not imply one. A crash in between is roll-
forward-only and blocks another writer or final sealed proof. Quiesce constructs
`SealedProof` only after every such sidecar and substrate attempt is settled, so
the proof cannot be invalidated by later retention work.

The patch must also prevent shard-manifest, ordinary claim, and reclaim history
from growing forever. Reclaim IDs are `(checkpoint_epoch, caller_uuid)` and
ordinary claim IDs are `(checkpoint_epoch, claim_kind, claim_uuid)`; the epoch
is part of both identities. Every ordinary claim attempt reaches a durable
`aborted_no_effect(receipt) | complete(receipt)` terminal state under the same
rule as reclaim: once its successor sentinel exists, it cannot abort and
same-attempt recovery must finish or retain the pending record. A checkpoint
may begin only after every claim/reclaim attempt in the current epoch is
terminal and its declared retry horizon has elapsed, and after every older data
or control reservation/materialization attempt is terminal and past its retry
horizon, or represented as an exact still-charged entry that must survive. The
checkpoint operation
allocates `next_checkpoint_epoch = current + 1`; its own checkpoint claim ID and
receipt belong to that next epoch, not the history it is about to expire. It
first advances the writer epoch through the same attempt-owned successor-
sentinel claim and durably terminals that claim. It then writes one
deterministically addressed immutable checkpoint body over the exact
**post-claim** state: complete binding/configuration, latest shard
manifest/epoch/monotonic current-generation/replay witness, retained known/unknown object inventory and
digests, orphan-classification summary, reservation-ledger watermark plus every
still-charged reservation, terminal generation/materialization/settlement and
control-reservation summaries, terminal reclaim summary, and terminal ordinary-
claim summary including the checkpoint claim itself. The claim summary
preserves every retained historical sentinel's exact position/digest/epoch
authority.
Only then does the operation conditionally swap the authoritative retention-
bootstrap pointer to that body. A lost checkpoint response is resolved from the
new body's checkpoint receipt during its declared horizon; only a later
checkpoint may expire it. Older reservation-ledger records are deletable only
after their exact charged/settled state is present in the authoritative body.
The new checkpoint epoch expires summarized terminal reservation IDs with typed
`ReservationExpired`; carried still-charged IDs remain live and cannot reserve
again. The same UUID under the new checkpoint epoch is a distinct identity, so
expiry never requires an unbounded tombstone set.

All patched readers discover latest state from that bootstrap pointer and then
follow a contiguous successor chain; best-effort latest hints are not authority.
A crash before the pointer CAS leaves a classified checkpoint-body orphan. A
crash after it makes the new body authoritative, after which older manifest,
claim/reclaim attempt, receipt, terminal reservation/materialization,
settlement, and obsolete control-ledger objects may be removed idempotently. The
new checkpoint epoch expires every old reclaim and ordinary-claim ID: retry
returns typed `ReceiptExpired` or `ClaimReceiptExpired`, respectively, and the
same UUID in the new epoch is a different identity.

There is no absent-pointer bootstrap mode. B2b enrollment or sealed rebuild asks
the patched Lance initializer to create an immutable genesis checkpoint body
with empty claim/reclaim summaries and conditionally install its bootstrap
pointer **before** committing the B2b MemWAL details/index kind. The enrollment
recovery envelope binds the genesis body, pointer, details commit, empty shard,
and final lifecycle publication; a crash before graph publication either
completes that exact prefix or refuses foreign/malformed residue. The first B2b
reader therefore always starts from an authoritative body, while a body/pointer
left before the details commit is classified enrollment-owned state rather than
silently adopted.

This is not encoded as an unknown protobuf field on RC.1's accepted
`MemWalIndexDetails`/index-version 0 shape, because RC.1 may ignore it.
Stream-config v3 uses a new details type URL or system-index kind that the
reviewed patch understands and stock RC.1 is proved to reject before opening
shard state. Checkpoint activation never strands an already-open old reader on
the legacy kind. Genuine patched↔RC.1 and graph-v8↔v9 tests pin genesis
body/pointer/details publication, every later checkpoint crash boundary, ID
expiry, and refusal to fall back to `version_hint`. If the bootstrap, complete
summary, ID expiry, or bounded compaction cannot be proved, public activation
under B2b remains inactive; periodic rebuild is not a substitute for an
unbounded or
unrecoverable MemWAL namespace. Even after that namespace is bounded, the
separate whole-root lifetime limit below still applies.

Before WAL prefix deletion is enabled, Lance must also recheck shard epoch
after every successful WAL atomic PUT and return a typed fence/unknown outcome
when a successor won. The patch carries the adversarial
deleted-successor-sentinel regression on local and object storage. This bounded
primitive is not advertised for overlapping processes: that later topology
requires a durable
`RECLAIMING`/sealed maintenance intent so a new claimant cannot enter between
prune and physical deletion.

OmniGraph grants eligibility only at one quiescent whole-cut boundary. All of
the following are necessary:

1. admission is exclusively closed and every writer, watcher, flush handler,
   retirement owner, and reclaim owner is settled or durably retired;
2. the live and frozen MemTables and in-flight flush set are empty, and every
   flushed generation has an exact graph-visible base/token-table outcome with
   recovery resolved;
3. maintained indexes have caught up, no Fresh-read or retained-version guard
   needs the cut, and the planned successor shard manifest has an empty complete
   flushed-generation set—not merely no unmerged generation through a partial
   cut;
4. the WAL cutoff equals the captured authoritative
   `replay_after_wal_entry_position`; because RC.1 has no per-generation WAL
   ranges, a smaller data prefix is not treated as proved. Exact inventory proves
   no data-bearing WAL entry above that old cutoff and binds the maximum position
   of every authenticated historical sentinel/object in the full tail. After the
   prune CAS, the empty generation set, unchanged monotonic
   `current_generation`, base `merged_generations` coverage, and successor cursor
   equal to the new sentinel position are re-proved. The mutable
   `wal_entry_position_last_seen` hint is never authority; and
5. the successor-epoch empty fence sentinel is durably created at checked
   `max_authenticated_position + 1`, named by the successor manifest/cursor,
   excluded from deletion, and remains decodable after reclamation. Position
   overflow or a conditional-create collision refuses. An older empty sentinel is deletable
   only when its position/digest/epoch is authenticated by the checkpoint plus
   retained successor chain and it lies in the opaque plan; a data-bearing entry
   is never exempted as a sentinel.

Data HEAD, merge progress, age, or any one cursor alone is insufficient. The
Lance receipt records the predicates and the post-prune proof; OmniGraph does
not reconstruct them from paths.

Exact orphan/unknown accounting additionally requires a backend capability that
guarantees HEAD/GET and LIST visibility after successful PUT **and** DELETE for
the `_mem_wal` namespace. If that capability is absent, public activation under
B2b is refused unless the Lance patch provides its own durable complete object
accounting that does not depend on a possibly stale listing. That accounting
includes incomplete multipart uploads, which ordinary object LIST does not
return. Current-key visibility is still insufficient on a versioned,
soft-delete, or Object-Lock/retention-enabled namespace: noncurrent versions,
delete markers, retained locked objects, and incomplete uploads may continue to
consume billed storage after the current key disappears. The initial public B2b
profile refuses those configurations unless the patched backend can enumerate
and byte-account every retained version/marker/lock, permanently delete each
eligible version, and keep ineligible retained bytes charged until verified
removal or expiry. A successful best-effort current-object list is evidence for
the negative RC.1 guards, not a production completeness or cost proof.

Public activation under B2b also requires a hard **admission watermark**, not a
maximum observed in a benchmark and relabeled as a guarantee. Exact cold inventory
counts every object/byte under `_mem_wal`: WAL, referenced generations and
PK/Bloom sidecars, recognized orphans, shard-manifest history/checkpoints,
ordinary claim and reclaim attempt/receipt records, and malformed/unknown
residue. Runtime may cache only a conservative
`observed + reserved_inflight` meter; it never decrements at fold, only after an
exact reclaim receipt plus a new complete inventory.

The configured object/byte domain is one exact physical stream binding: base
dataset URI/main ref, enrollment ID, and every current or future shard under
that binding's `_mem_wal` namespace. It is not a silently shared graph-wide
quota. Different table bindings have separately configured limits; a later
graph/account quota is an additional admission layer, not a guarantee claimed
here. Inside one binding, the bootstrap-selected Lance retention ledger is the
single reservation authority. Every generation, ordinary claim, reclaim, and
checkpoint reservation conditionally advances that ledger, so concurrent
shards or callers cannot each pass a cached capacity check. Cold open rebuilds
the meter from the authoritative bootstrap/contiguous ledger plus exact
inventory before admission.

Before the first PUT belonging to a legal generation, Lance must return and
enforce a source-derived `max_physical_growth(bytes, objects)` reservation (or
an equivalent storage quota) covering WAL entries, generation data,
PK/Bloom sidecars, manifests/checkpoints, and the configured bounded retry
allowance. Before any WAL PUT, multipart creation, or generation-output write,
Lance conditionally persists an enumerable ledger record with the durable
`generation_reservation_id = (checkpoint_epoch, generation_uuid)`, exact
binding/generation, maximum object/byte charge, hard
`max_generation_materialization_attempts`, attempt number, and status. Control
reservation IDs likewise use `(checkpoint_epoch, control_kind, control_uuid)`.
Only that reserved ID may create the covered effects. A retry must reuse
the same deterministically addressed output, or reclaim the prior never-
referenced partial output inside that reservation before allocating the next
attempt. It may never create randomized orphan output repeatedly outside the
envelope; an exhausted attempt count stops admission and requires reclaim or
sealed rebuild. One logical generation retains that reservation across
crash/retry and cannot reserve the same allowance repeatedly. Admission
succeeds only when
`observed + reserved_inflight + max_physical_growth` fits both configured
limits. Otherwise it returns `RetainedStorageLimitExceeded` before
`put_no_wait`; fold, correction, status, quiesce, and rebuild remain available.
Under the supported single-writer boundary, physical growth is then bounded by
the already-reserved envelopes even while those writes are in flight. Any
unknown object, incomplete inventory, or write outside an enforced envelope
closes admission.

Reservation settlement is also durable and conditional. A crash after reserve
but before effect releases the charge only after exact no-effect inventory. Any
owned effect or ambiguity keeps the full maximum charged and permits only
same-ID recovery. After materialization, a complete inventory may atomically
associate the reservation with its exact retained objects/bytes and reduce
`reserved_inflight` only to the still-possible unmaterialized remainder (zero
when the envelope is terminal). Those materialized bytes remain in `observed`,
so they are never counted twice and the remaining legal growth is never
undercharged. A reclaim receipt plus a new complete inventory may reduce
`observed` for verified deleted physical bytes; it does not release them from a
second bucket. Fold success alone never settles storage. Cold open enumerates
every nonterminal reservation before admission, and an object/upload without
its prior reservation is unknown state, not retrospectively adopted.

On object stores, every multipart upload/part opened for the reservation has a
durable upload identity and charged byte/object allowance. Same-plan recovery
must complete or explicitly abort it before another materialization attempt;
the retained-state inspector must list/account for it through the backend's
multipart API even though ordinary LIST cannot. A backend without exact
multipart accounting/abort semantics cannot enable B2b. The
local/RustFS/S3-compatible matrix repeatedly crashes before multipart complete
and proves retained charged bytes plus attempts remain within the envelope.

The configured object/byte limit also withholds a source-derived
`control_headroom` that row admission can never consume. Stream-config v3 hard-
caps outstanding control attempts, unexpired terminal claim/reclaim records and
bytes per checkpoint epoch, checkpoint-body bytes, and checkpoint-body orphans.
At most one checkpoint attempt/body exists per binding: its body path is
deterministic from `(checkpoint_epoch, checkpoint_id)`, same-ID recovery reuses
or removes that body, and another ID is refused while it is pending. Stale
effect-free plans consume a bounded terminal slot; they cannot create an
unbounded receipt or orphan loop.

The headroom is sized for all capped unexpired terminal history, one pending
same-ID claim recovery, one maximum new-or-pending reclaim attempt/receipt plus
same-ID recovery, **two sequential maximum closure claim envelopes and their
recoveries/terminal receipts** (abort-drain after correction, then requiesce/
seal), one deterministic checkpoint body/sentinel/manifest/pointer swap, and
the maximum recovery record set. Both closure receipts may coexist until their
retry horizons elapse; the design does not assume an intervening checkpoint can
compact the first. Those control effects reserve through the same durable per-
binding ledger but from the non-admission pool. Row admission stops with typed
`ControlHeadroomExceeded` before it consumes the emergency floor; same-ID
recovery, status, fold/correction, quiesce, reclaim, checkpoint, and sealed
rebuild stay available. If Lance cannot prove these history/orphan limits, the
reserve-first ledger, or forward-progress headroom, B2b must stop before public
activation rather than discover at runtime that a full WAL cannot be reclaimed.

Local and RustFS measurements across row/byte caps, wide schemas, blobs,
PK/Bloom output, fragmented batches, crashes, and retries validate the
estimator/quota and catch regressions; they do not create the bound. Arrow or
RSS bytes are not disk bytes. A patch that can only report measured growth, or
that cannot checkpoint its own history, does not satisfy B2b.

#### 4.5.3 Deferred bounded-storage accounting (not a B2a gate)

The earlier B2-0 design proposed a graph-global `GraphHistoryBudget`, physical-
growth reservations for every manifest publisher, per-stream closure reserves,
and hard aggregate receipt/storage caps. That design answered a different
product promise: continue operating indefinitely inside a finite, enforced
storage envelope. The selected unbounded retain-all profile makes no such
promise, so none of those mechanisms is part of B2a's schema, gate order,
admission path, recovery payload, error surface, or activation criteria.

This is not permission to make process memory or individual operations
unbounded. B2a keeps the row, logical-Arrow-byte, worker, queue, deadline,
transaction-chain, response-page, and retry bounds specified elsewhere. It
also keeps every correctness obligation: durable acknowledgement, exact
recovery ownership for authority effects, one manifest visibility point,
compare-and-chain tokens, trusted attribution, revision-fenced lifecycle, and
strict correction. Only cumulative physical storage and append-only protocol
history are deliberately unmetered.

If OmniGraph later promises bounded retained storage, automatic reclamation,
or indefinite in-place operation under a configured quota, that feature needs
a new accepted amendment and evidence at that boundary. B2b's Lance-owned
reclamation/accounting work in §4.5.2 is the current research direction; it is
not a prerequisite for B2a and cannot be smuggled into B2a through raw deletes
or an advisory counter.

### 4.6 Public surface after the gates close

The shipped `POST /graphs/{id}/ingest` path remains the deprecated, compatible
alias of `/load`. F7a gives streaming one graph-native, non-conflicting row
surface:

```text
POST /graphs/{graph_id}/stream/ingest
```

The URL and policy resource stop at the graph. A caller may mix logical node
and edge declarations in one ordered request; it never selects a physical
dataset, table incarnation, MemWAL lane, writer, shard, epoch, or generation.
Declaration resolution, lazy private-lane preparation, and automatic folding
remain engine/runtime responsibilities. F7a adds no durable coordinator or
format state. Graph-level lifecycle, status, and maintenance routes require
their own later design and evidence; the former type/lane-specific route sketch
is not a public contract.

The ingest request and response use `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson` and
`Accept: application/x-ndjson`.

Before body ownership, the route requires one strong `If-Match` value derived
from existing graph identity, accepted schema/catalog authority, streaming
profile revision, and live fold delegation. Missing `If-Match` is an
effect-free HTTP `428` challenge carrying the current strong `ETag`; it does
not poll the body or create lane state. A malformed or stale value returns
HTTP `412` without replacement authority and without polling the body. Clients
may perform the missing-token challenge before opening input, but must never
automatically replay an already-owned body after `412`. The token is derived
authority, not persisted coordination state.

Each input line is one graph row payload plus the compare-and-chain envelope.
The contributor is never accepted from the body:

```json
{"type":"Person","data":{"id":"n-17","name":"Ada"},"$stream":{"write_id":"8a880f0a-3f41-4a42-9b0e-f34af0a9a4df","predecessor_token":null}}
```

An edge line uses `edge`, `from`, `to`, `data`, and the same `$stream`
envelope. The engine resolves the private stream incarnation from the accepted
graph catalog; clients cannot supply or observe it.

Each output line corresponds to the same input ordinal:

```json
{"ordinal":17,"status":"durable","scope":"row","kind":"node","type":"Person","id":"n-17","write_id":"8a880f0a-3f41-4a42-9b0e-f34af0a9a4df","stream_token":"sha256:..."}
```

The response union is tagged and graph-logical rather than pretending every
outcome created a new admission attempt or exposing private lane evidence.
Exact JSON `status` values are `durable`,
`ack_unknown`, `already_durable`, `withdrawn`, `dead_lettered`, `invalid`,
`stream_input_too_large`, `stream_authority_changed`,
`stream_sequence_conflict`, `stream_idempotency_conflict`,
`stream_fold_required`, `stream_backpressure`,
`recovery_required`, and `stream_retry_required`;
CamelCase names below denote the corresponding engine error/disposition types.
An unresolved recovery found by the request-level barrier before any body line
is admitted may return the ordinary HTTP 503 `RecoveryRequired` envelope. Once
the adapter has accepted an ordinal or emitted any line, the same condition is
represented only by per-line `recovery_required` plus the stop-tail rule below;
partial success never changes into an HTTP error.

Every line includes `ordinal`, `status`, and `scope` (`row | graph`). When
known from the submitted logical row it also includes `kind`, `type`, `id`,
and `write_id`. Token fields are intentionally semantic: `stream_token` is
confirmed authority, `current_token` names a confirmed conflicting/current
occurrence, and `unconfirmed_candidate_token` is never represented as current.
Safe messages, exact single-row `limit`/`actual`, and
`blocking_ordinal`/`blocking_status` are included only when applicable.
Responses never expose stream incarnation, enrollment, binding, table,
dataset, shard, writer, epoch, generation, recovery sidecar, object URI, digest,
or native HEAD evidence.

- `durable` and `already_durable` return the confirmed `stream_token`;
- `ack_unknown` / `AckUnknown` returns
  `unconfirmed_candidate_token`; it never labels that token current;
- `withdrawn` and `dead_lettered` return the current terminal token without
  exposing correction, dead-letter-object, or fold internals;
- `invalid` is the effect-free per-line parse/schema/normalization error and
  creates no attempt;
- `stream_input_too_large` means the exact normalized single row cannot fit an
  otherwise empty legal generation. It is terminal for that line, creates no
  attempt, and does not ask the caller to fold and retry an impossible row;
- `stream_authority_changed` graph-redacts binding, lifecycle, profile,
  schema, and resume-required movement into one effect-free retry boundary;
- `stream_sequence_conflict` and `stream_idempotency_conflict` are effect-free
  row outcomes and may return only safe current-token evidence;
- `stream_fold_required` is an effect-free admission refusal with no attempt.
  It means the next legal row/run fits an empty generation but not the bounded
  resident generation and must be folded before retry. B2a defines no retained-
  storage, control-headroom, aggregate-receipt-capacity, or graph-history-budget
  refusal;
- `stream_backpressure` is an effect-free admission/queue deadline reached
  before `put_no_wait`; it carries retry guidance but no durability claim or
  attempt;
- `recovery_required` means a pre-invocation recovery/retirement operation
  remains authoritative and could not finish within the request deadline. It
  exposes no recovery identity, new admission attempt, or token claim; and
- `stream_retry_required` means the line was not invoked because an earlier
  physical run became `AckUnknown`; it carries the blocking ordinal/status but
  no private attempt or token claim for this line.

RC.1 exposes a durability completion, not an exact per-put WAL receipt.
`BatchDurableWatcher::wait()` returns only `Result<()>`;
`WriteResult.batch_positions` names positions local to the active
MemTable/`BatchStore` and resets after rollover;
and `wal_stats().next_wal_entry_position` is a mutable next-position statistic.
None is an authoritative durable row address, so OmniGraph never derives or
publishes `wal_position` from those surfaces. One normalized Lance put may
cover several input ordinals; their response lines become eligible together
after the shared watcher succeeds and are still emitted in caller order.

The B1 core accepts one non-empty, contiguous ordinal range and validates the
whole normalized batch before invoking Lance; a validation failure is
all-or-nothing for that B1 call. The B2 HTTP/CLI adapter owns NDJSON parsing,
batching, and the reorder buffer. It closes and submits the preceding
contiguous valid run when it encounters an invalid line, emits the validation
error for that ordinal, and begins a new contiguous run afterward. It never
passes a non-contiguous range to B1. Previously acknowledged runs in the same
request remain durable; the response is a stream, not an all-request
transaction. Ordering, cancellation, and retry rules are explicit:

The adapter never collects a request. Per request it retains at most one
submitted run and one accumulating run, each within 8,192 rows / 32 MiB, plus
one run of result/reorder statuses. A raw line above 32 MiB is terminal before
materialization. Before accepting body ownership it also acquires a separate
root-wide transport slot/byte budget that charges every live raw accumulator,
normalized run, result queue, and reorder owner; concurrent slow clients cannot
multiply the per-request bound without limit. That budget is additional to the
two root-wide 128-MiB B2 preprocessing envelopes. Parser expansion/RSS evidence
sets its exact defaults before public activation.

Before adding a normalized row to a run, the adapter computes its logical
dense-slice Arrow charge after tombstone/hidden-metadata injection. A single row above
32 MiB is
`stream_input_too_large`; the adapter closes the preceding run and may continue
with later lines. Otherwise it forms only runs that fit both the per-call bound
and the resident generation's exact remaining row/byte allowance. If the next
legal row/run fits an empty generation but not the remaining resident allowance,
the result is `stream_fold_required`. This empty-generation test is mandatory,
so fold/retry cannot loop forever on an intrinsically oversized payload.

- acknowledgements are emitted in input order for one HTTP stream;
- disconnecting does not cancel entries whose durability waiter resolved;
- cancellation or failure after `put_no_wait` but before a successful watcher
  result is `AckUnknown`, not proof of non-durability;
- a missing response is ambiguous. Retrying the same stream incarnation,
  authenticated actor, `write_id`, predecessor, and payload follows §4.1:
  exact current `X` returns `already_durable`, absent `X` may be submitted again
  against its still-current predecessor, and a newer `Y` yields
  `StreamSequenceConflict` before any Lance call;
- server shutdown stops admission, drains durability waiters up to a bound, and
  reports any unacknowledged tail as unknown to the client.

Token dispositions are physical-run boundaries too. A row that is
`already_durable`, `withdrawn`, F5 `dead_lettered`, binding-conflicted,
sequence-conflicted, or
idempotency-conflicted first waits for the preceding submitted run, then is
evaluated against the resulting confirmed overlay without entering that run.
Later rows are re-evaluated in caller order. For one key, reachable same-request
sequences include `new / already / conflict`: the exact retry of the first
occurrence becomes already-current, while another candidate that still names
the old predecessor conflicts. Mixed-key `new / conflict / new` is also
deterministic. Fresh same-key successors may share one
generation after separate durable calls, but never one physical run: tokens are
opaque, so the later caller cannot name an unconfirmed predecessor. A physical
run contains at most one fresh candidate per key. `AckUnknown` retires that
worker and stops further physical admission for the stream request; rows not
yet invoked receive an effect-free `stream_retry_required` result.
`on_reject="strict"` describes fold validation—it does not turn the NDJSON
response stream into an atomic request.

An `AckUnknown`, effect-free capacity/backpressure refusal,
`stream_lifecycle_changed`, `stream_authority_changed`, or
`recovery_required` stops further physical admission for that request. The
blocking line receives its exact status; each later otherwise-admissible,
uninvoked line receives the appropriate tail status plus `blocking_ordinal`
(`stream_retry_required` for an `AckUnknown`, otherwise the same blocking
status). The adapter nevertheless continues effect-free parsing, schema
validation, normalization, and intrinsic single-row sizing after the blocker.
A later parse/schema/normalization failure remains `invalid`, and a later row
that cannot fit an empty generation remains `stream_input_too_large`; those
adapter-local terminal results take precedence over any inherited tail blocker.
Every other uninvoked line inherits the blocker. No such line gets an
admission-attempt ID. This rule is identical when the blocker appears after
earlier `durable` output, so the handler never converts partial NDJSON success
into an HTTP-level error or confuses capacity/recovery with `AckUnknown`.

CLI commands mirror the new namespace rather than overloading deprecated
`omnigraph ingest`:

```text
omnigraph stream ingest --data <PATH|-> [--graph-token <opaque-token>] ...
```

It is served-only and graph-addressed. Without `--graph-token`, the client
completes the bodyless `428` challenge before opening the path or stdin, then
sends the body exactly once. Supplying a token skips that preflight. A `412`
never triggers token replacement or replay. Direct `--store`, embedded use,
and client-supplied `--as` refuse before input is opened. Future lifecycle,
status, correction, and maintenance commands must be graph-level even if their
implementation delegates to private lanes; F7a does not reserve their CLI
grammar.

Future HTTP fold, quiesce, resume/abort-drain, and correction bodies likewise require
their operation ID plus expected lifecycle revision; status and block-view
responses expose the revision to use as the compare token. Exact occurrence
plus intent is retry-safe after a lost response, while stale revision refuses
without retargeting. `enroll` requires caller-minted
`enrollment_request_id` internally and returns tagged `enrolled | already_enrolled` to
the graph adapter; those lane identities are not public. `correct` requires `block_token`,
caller-minted `correction_id`, and explicit ordered `REPLACE | WITHDRAW`
actions. The engine derives the canonical plan digest from §4.4; an optional
client digest is only an equality assertion. It returns the immutable
correction receipt. `block show`/the block endpoint returns the digest-verified,
paginated planning view needed to construct those actions; it never returns
whole blocked rows. `rebuild-preflight` is a fresh under-gate proof, not a cached
status alias.

Every endpoint has a dedicated OpenAPI operation and handler tests. Ingest
passes the engine `stream_ingest` Cedar action and per-actor admission
accounting before acquiring a shard writer; fold, quiesce, resume/abort-drain,
enroll, block inspection, correct, and rebuild-preflight use the separate
`stream_manage` action. Status is authorized like other graph operational
metadata. The full non-experimental surface applies the same engine gates to
embedded and remote CLI use; §4.7 deliberately narrows mutation to the owned
cluster runtime and keeps the direct arm as a typed refusal.

Phase B2 initially exposes only strict compare-and-chain upsert. The full
product surface described in this section requires the full exclusive-cut
`status`, explicit `fold`, persistent `quiesce`, `resume`/abort-drain, rebuild
preflight, a bounded strict-correction workflow, durable
authenticated-contributor attribution, a same-key `AckUnknown`
sequencing/idempotency contract, and one proved physical-retention profile.
Full status includes lifecycle and
binding/revision, current epoch, pending generations/bytes, last fold error,
current receipt identifiers/summaries, and whether strict fold is blocked. It
does not expose receipt-history pagination and never claims to resolve one
caller's `AckUnknown`. A future permanent management-audit product requires a
separate retention/cost decision.
For the full non-experimental surface, dead-letter row identity and operation,
richer status, and configurable policy remain Phase C, while automatic
operation-scoped drain, SchemaApply/branch integration, upgrade orchestration,
and physical rebind remain Phase D. The selected experimental profile below
pulls forward a bounded dead-letter strand and an explicit `SEALED`
maintenance/rebind bridge; it does not claim the automatic Phase D workflow.

### 4.7 Experimental activation profile (selected 2026-07-27)

**Amended 2026-07-29:** the functionality-first profile-authority tranche is
implemented as internal graph schema **v11**, profile protocol v2, and sidecar
schema **v13**. `protocol_v10` remains byte-for-byte historical enrollment and
`protocol_v12` remains byte-for-byte ordinary `StreamFold`. V13 emits only
`StreamProfileChange`, whose exact token-ledger
`ProfileManagementReceipt` transaction and fixed next profile are selected
together at the terminal manifest CAS. Unknown v13 variants fail closed.

V11 adds capability-bound cluster control/runtime ownership, a bounded profile
receipt-chain reference, the discriminated
`DISABLED | ENABLED | DISABLING | RETIRED` profile protocol, fixed-principal
fold delegation/continuation, and mandatory retirement receipt/cut fields.
`DISABLING` is an explicit restart/resume plan; disable can finish with no
lifecycle rows or only already-`SEALED` lanes, while a non-`SEALED` enrolled
lane remains pending. `RETIRED` decodes and fences
writers but its transition and read/export activation are not implemented.

The implementation deliberately does not pre-register unsettled lifecycle
shapes under v13. Claim receipts, `StreamEnrollmentV2`, ordinary
`StreamFoldV2`, drain-fold, `StreamLifecycleReceipt`, resume/abort,
data/authority correction, `StreamAuthorityRetirement`, token-ledger-index
maintenance, sealed maintenance, and rebind required another strict
graph/recovery strand. F3e later activated retirement before F3f created the
first supported `WITHDRAWN`; the later dead-letter strand must extend it before
`DEAD_LETTERED`. P2's product/transport surface and P3–P7 remained unimplemented
at this tranche.
The bounded tranche requires
genuine v10↔v11 old-binary/new-format refusal and rebuild evidence.

This section records the selected parameters for the first public activation
of the streaming lane as an explicitly experimental, cluster-only feature. It
narrows §4.6 and amends §7 as stated below; where this profile and an earlier
section disagree, this profile governs the experimental activation and the
earlier text continues to describe the full product surface.

**Implementation status (2026-07-29): P1, the authorization/status split, and
the bounded profile-authority tranche are implemented.** The
pre-implementation format audit
resolved to its pre-registered default (v9 decoders skip unknown row kinds
silently, and the correct shape is a required genesis singleton), so v10 adds
the graph-global `stream_profile` row and the explicit-null fold-attribution
dead-letter placeholder in the same bump. That placeholder is now frozen; F5
uses a new versioned attribution shape. The historical ambient single-CAS flip is
replaced in v11 by the capability-bound, recovery-v13 profile adapter described
above. `cluster apply` owns the stopped/offline transition and the server owns
the checked runtime lifetime; refresh converges the ledger to engine truth and
disable remains typed
(`StreamingDisablePending`) while any lifecycle is non-terminal. The genuine
v9↔v10 refusal/rebuild fence is pinned in CI (`OMNIGRAPH_V9_BIN`).
`stream_ingest` and `stream_manage` are registered graph-scoped actions; both
reject branch and target-branch qualifiers. Embedded
`Omnigraph::stream_status` reads the enablement and per-lane durable authority
from one canonical-main manifest snapshot, including the lifecycle revision
future management verbs pass back as their compare token. It is read-only,
takes no admission lease, resolves no recovery, and deliberately omits
physical observations. F6b6 later added a separate engine-internal checked
operational cut with physical, token, recovery, advisory-driver, and rebuild
  evidence plus typed movement/deadline refusal. It remains read-only; exact cold-replay pending accounting and oldest uncovered
token age are explicit unavailable values, as is flushed LWW projection
accounting. `DISABLING` uses explicit checked cluster-apply status authority.
All pending sidecars inside the hard status envelope are reported and rebuild-
blocking; exceeding any discovery bound refuses the whole status. Only an exact
canonical-main recovery participant outcome makes physical movement an
  unavailable projection rather than a change. F7b exposes only its graph-
  redacted served HTTP/OpenAPI and remote-CLI projection; direct-SDK checked
  status remains inactive. The private P2 prepare proof has no enrollment
product surface. F7a activates graph ingress and F7c activates only graph-wide
resume and checked `SEALED` maintenance; per-declaration lifecycle/rebind and
direct SDK control remain inactive. Ambient embedded SDK and direct-store
callers cannot mint the checked authority required to mutate it.

**Profile boundaries.** Main-only; unsharded; one resident writer root-wide; one
externally enforced live writer process (the process-local lease does not
detect a foreign OS process); unbounded retain-all (§4.5.1); cluster deployments only;
strict compare-and-chain upsert only. Stream deletes remain Phase F, and this
profile confirms upsert-only as a deliberate lane boundary rather than an
interim limitation: high-rate producers emit facts, removal is a decision that
needs the future token-aware delete transition, and one-directional
constructive folds keep P6's ordering stable. Both streamed deletes and direct
deletes on an enrolled table are refused in this profile; an ordinary direct
delete is possible only before enrollment. No fresh reads (Phase E); no automatic
operation drain (Phase D). While the profile is `ENABLED` or `DISABLING`,
operator-only Cedar policy is not sufficient process ownership. While the
profile is `ENABLED`, streaming admission and ordinary Mutation/Load/delete
must originate in the one served runtime and carry its checked runtime
authority. BranchMerge is stricter and remains refused under both `ENABLED`
and `DISABLING`, even with that runtime, because this tranche has no
token-aware merge transition.
While it is `DISABLING`, the stopped-server offline owner may perform only the
continuation's recovery/fold/correction effects; ordinary content mutation is
closed. Embedded SDK and direct `--store` mutation therefore return
`StreamingRequiresClusterRuntime` before body ownership or effect whenever the
profile is `ENABLED | DISABLING`, even for an operator actor. They still read
the durable flag and obey every ordinary-writer lifecycle fence when the
profile is disabled. Cedar remains the additional actor/action check, not a
substitute for the engine-enforced one-live-writer boundary.

#### P1 — Enablement authority (selected: cluster-declared, manifest-propagated)

Streaming is enabled per graph by a declaration in the team-owned
`cluster.yaml`; `cluster apply` is the only flip mechanism. F2 removes the
ambient `Omnigraph::set_streaming_enabled_as` writer and replaces it with a
narrow control-plane adapter requiring `CheckedClusterApplyAuthority`. That
authority is distinct from the serving runtime capability, is minted only
while reconciling one validated cluster snapshot, and binds cluster/root
identity, graph/store mapping, resource-local declaration revision/digest,
desired profile, and authenticated apply actor. That revision is derived from
this graph and declaration rather than the global cluster-config digest, so
unrelated configuration edits do not invalidate the live runtime. The engine
revalidates that scope and
`stream_manage` before its exact-entry CAS. Cluster apply supplies a
conjunctive checker spanning the graph policy in the currently applied and
desired revisions through the profile effect → state-CAS window. Both policies
must allow the actor when both are bound; if only one is bound, it governs, and
an unchanged address/digest pair is compiled once. A newly needed grant must
therefore land in a policy-only apply before the profile transition, while a
revocation follows the transition in a second apply. If the profile transition
is blocked, current- or desired-bound policy changes for that graph are
demoted before the state CAS so the currently selected policy remains
available to authorize a retry. V11 profile mutations carry a stable apply
operation ID plus expected profile revision. Each appends one
immutable, individually bounded `ProfileManagementReceipt` to the indexed
`_stream_tokens` control ledger; `StreamProfileV11` holds only its bounded
receipt-chain reference. Recovery-v13 pre-mints the ledger transaction, and
the one terminal manifest CAS advances the ledger pointer, profile row, and
chain commitment together. An exact delayed reconciliation retry performs the
indexed lookup and returns its original result instead of targeting a later
profile cycle. There is no ambient constructor or raw engine flip;
embedded/direct callers receive `StreamingRequiresClusterControlPlane`.
The stable operation ID and request digest deliberately exclude actor, while
the receipt stores actor and commits it in the record identity. Exact terminal
replay separately requires that same actor; a different actor cannot adopt the
receipt after an engine-effect/state-CAS crash. When the original identity is
unavailable, `cluster refresh` reconstructs the state ledger from authoritative
manifest truth before a replacement actor replans; it does not rewrite receipt
attribution.

The capability types and their minting path must respect the crate dependency
graph, but that placement is not a trivial scaffold. Before F2 freezes v11, a
compile-level spike must resolve the existing dependency:
`omnigraph-cluster::store::StateLockGuard` owns the engine's
`StorageAdapter`. Moving the guard below the engine without moving that storage
boundary would create a cycle or duplicate the one file/S3 cluster-storage
path. The spike must select either a shared lower storage leaf plus a
control-authority leaf, or another concrete cycle-free design that preserves
one storage path and unforgeable minting. It must compile engine, cluster,
server, and CLI, record the internal dependency and crates.io publish order,
and identify every workspace/lockfile/CI/classifier/inventory update. It does
not put filesystem/lock behavior in `omnigraph-api-types` and does not accept a
caller-implemented trait as authority.

The selected lower boundary will own canonical cluster snapshot/store-mapping
validation and the lifetime-bound state-lock or runtime writer guard.
`CheckedClusterApplyAuthority`, `CheckedClusterStreamRuntimeAuthority`, and
the narrower `CheckedClusterServedExportAuthority` have private,
non-serializable, non-cloneable fields and borrow or own those guards; their
only production factories perform the validation and acquire the appropriate
guard. The served-export factory accepts a checked cluster server boot with the
exact graph/store mapping and manifest profile `DISABLED | RETIRED`; it is
distinct from the live runtime capability and grants no writer operation.
Because Rust has no
friend-crate visibility and the cluster/server crates already depend on the
engine, engine adapters used across that boundary are `#[doc(hidden)] pub` and
require one of these unforgeable values—they are not `pub(crate)` methods that
an upper crate could not call. The direct `--store` mutation path and embedded
SDK have neither a validated cluster snapshot nor a guard and cannot mint one;
the cluster-control CLI reaches the factory only through its checked apply
workflow. Feature-gated tests use a separate test-only factory. The selected
design keeps the engine independent of `omnigraph-cluster` and
`omnigraph-server`. The 2026-07-29 entry scaffold establishes that cycle-free
nine-crate dependency edge, the one shared storage implementation, and exact
persisted-lock ownership only. It deliberately defers the `Checked*` types and
their factories until every binding named above can co-land.

One process topology is supported for a streaming-profile change. The
deployment controller gracefully stops every writer-capable process for the
graph (normally the sole server) and confirms process exit. F2 owns this
minimal handoff and its synchronous offline drain loop; no production
streaming admission/supervisor exists in that slice. F5 later strengthens
server shutdown to close transport admission, settle the invoked tail, and
join every supervisor/worker before exit, and factors the shared scheduler core
without changing ownership. Only after the handoff may
`cluster apply --confirm-stream-offline` acquire the mandatory cluster state
lock, become the sole graph writer, and mint
`CheckedClusterApplyAuthority`; `state.lock: false` refuses this change. The
flag explicitly attests the experimental profile's externally enforced
single-writer precondition. It is not a distributed lease, and the
process-local gates do not claim to discover a foreign process. Plan and apply
output must additionally state that this release has no public firehose
ingress and that enabling the profile disables embedded/direct content
mutation. Explicit disable can reach `DISABLED` with no lanes or only
already-`SEALED` lanes, but it restores the embedded/direct lane only while the
graph remains unenrolled; after any table is enrolled, a strict rebuild is
required to restore that physical path. F2
updates the operator guide to make concurrent server/apply execution
unsupported for profile changes.

Before either transition's first profile CAS, apply runs the graph-global
recovery barrier while the old profile revision/delegation remains
authoritative and settles or refuses every graph-content or authority sidecar:
Mutation/Load, SchemaApply, BranchMerge, Optimize/EnsureIndices,
repair/cleanup, enrollment, writer claim/cold-WAL reconstruction, fold,
lifecycle, token-ledger maintenance, authority retirement (the lifecycle
strand or F5's version-appropriate terminal-authority strand), and rebind. It
then releases those gates,
reacquires from the root in canonical order, and recaptures/revalidates the
cleared authority. Ambiguous old recovery returns `RecoveryRequired` with no
profile effect. Enable then publishes its receipt and exits before server
restart. Disable is synchronous in that same no-ingress apply process: it
publishes `DISABLING`, constructs a temporary drain owner carrying only the
durable continuation, recovers/drains every manifest-selected lane, and
publishes `DISABLED`. A
crash is resumed by the next offline apply from the persisted plan. A
`DataBlock` leaves apply visibly pending; F3f's `cluster stream block
show|correct --confirm-stream-offline` commands acquire the same cluster lock
and narrow maintenance capability, after which apply may continue. They are
not direct `--store` mutations. A reserved `AuthorityBlock` remains
fail-closed until its future repair owner lands. Normal server startup refuses a `DISABLING` graph and
points to that offline recovery loop. Only after apply exits may a server
restart and validate the ledger result against the manifest profile revision
and delegation.

Apply propagates the decision as a durable `__manifest` row through the ordinary
publication door, so every process that opens the graph — server, direct
`--store` CLI, embedded — observes and obeys the flag regardless of access
path. This is the same engine-enforced-everywhere principle as Cedar: a
graph-wide safety property (the §5/§8 freeze depends on knowing streams may
exist) cannot live in per-process configuration. Enabling is metadata-only;
apart from its immutable control-ledger receipt, no stream table, shard, or WAL
is created until the first successful prepare for intended stream ingest (P2).
A client that prepares and then abandons or sends no rows may therefore leave
an empty enrolled `OPEN` lane; quiesce/disable must handle that lane through
the dedicated empty path.

V11 replaces the boolean profile with a discriminated state. Its enable CAS
installs a bounded immutable
`FoldDelegation`, issued by the Cedar-authorized apply actor to fixed system
principal `omnigraph:stream-fold` and bound to the
cluster/declaration/profile revision. Only exact `ENABLED` plus that delegation
and matching `CheckedClusterStreamRuntimeAuthority` permits row admission,
lazy enrollment, and automatic timer/cap folds.

```text
StreamProfileV11 {
    profile_revision,
    profile_receipt_chain: ReceiptChainRef,
    state:
        DISABLED
      | ENABLED {
            active_fold_delegation
        }
      | DISABLING {
            disable_plan           // owns FoldContinuation
        }
      | RETIRED {
            authority_retirement_receipt_id,
            authority_retirement_cut_digest
        },
}
```

`DISABLED` has neither active delegation, plan, nor retirement payload.
`ENABLED` has exactly one active delegation and no plan. The first disable CAS
consumes that active delegation into the plan's narrower continuation, leaving
no admission-authorizing delegation in `DISABLING`. `RETIRED` requires both
retirement fields, has only the exact `DISABLED -> RETIRED` incoming
transition, and has no outgoing transition. F2 decoded the dormant variant
fail-closed; F3e later activated the transition before F3f made `WITHDRAWN`
reachable.
Only exact recovery of an already-armed `StreamAuthorityRetirement` may finish
that transition. Every other graph, schema, branch, profile, lifecycle,
maintenance, writer-claim/fold, correction, enrollment, and content writer refuses
`RETIRED`; read-only open and repeated export of the exact recorded cut remain
available.

Disable is a durable two-publication management operation. F2 adds one
graph-profile admission gate outside every table gate and takes it exclusively
for the first disable CAS. That gate remains outermost for ordinary and other
non-resident-producing writers. F6b2 makes resident-producing served ingress
retain bounded preprocessing/inflight ownership, then acquire the root MemWAL
opportunity shared, graph-profile shared, table admission, and same-key queue.
These guards transfer through `put_no_wait`, watcher durability, and
same-writer fence classification. The driver holds root opportunity exclusive
across one frozen finite round and then takes profile/admission per candidate;
both permit kinds retain the worker-registry `Arc`, so a weak-root reopen
cannot create an independent fence. Runtime shutdown fences root opportunity
exclusive and then profile exclusive, drops both, and only then joins the
driver. These gates order owners within the one current process; they are not
the cross-process handoff. The required server-exit/apply-start sequence above
supplies that boundary. While holding the apply process's gate exclusively,
the capability-bound adapter CASes
`ENABLED -> DISABLING`, advances profile revision, and stores `DisablePlan {
operation_id, request_digest, declaration_revision, declaration_digest, actor,
fold_continuation }`. The continuation is derived from the prior delegation,
bound to the new disabling revision, and authorizes only recovery,
fold/quiesce, and terminal disable publication—not a put, enrollment, or
unrelated management operation. The first CAS therefore closes admission
before releasing the gate while retaining exactly the authority needed to
drain. For each manifest-selected lane the continuation follows exact current
state:

- `OPEN` derives a stable drain ID/request digest from `(disable operation ID,
  stable table identity, incarnation)` and runs ordinary receipt-bearing
  quiesce under the fixed system actor;
- `DRAINING(goal = SEALED)` continues that exact drain;
- `DRAINING(goal = OPEN_AFTER_FOLD)` first settles relevant owners, then runs
  metadata-only `DisableDrainAdoption`. Its deterministic ID derives from the
  disable operation, table identity, and existing drain ID. One CAS compares
  the complete profile plan/lifecycle row, preserves drain ID, block,
  witnesses, epoch targets, initiating actor/time, and null guarded operation,
  changes only goal to `SEALED`, records `seal_override`, increments revision,
  and advances the bounded management-receipt chain to the immutable ledger
  record selected by that CAS through
  `StreamLifecycleReceipt(kind = DisableDrainAdoption)`. Receipt lookup
  precedes row/revision checks.
  Corrections preserve the override and the same drain continues to its empty
  proof;
- a non-null guarded operation must settle before adoption and leaves disable
  visibly pending; `SEALED` needs no work.

This is the sole drain-goal retarget and neither opens admission nor discards a
block. The plan stores no parallel job queue; manifest lifecycle remains work
authority. A replacement offline apply reconstructs `DISABLING`, keeps
admission closed, and resumes those exact operations; a serving runtime does
not take over a partial disable. Once every lane is `SEALED` and relevant
recovery is settled, one exact CAS publishes
`DISABLING -> DISABLED`, advances the selected ledger pointer and bounded
profile-receipt chain to the terminal `ProfileManagementReceipt`, and clears
plan/delegation. Enable likewise uses one recovery-owned ledger transaction
plus one terminal manifest CAS; it is one graph-visible publication, not a
manifest-only write.

Profile-receipt/plan lookup precedes desired revision. While `DISABLING`, every
later offline apply first finishes the persisted old plan with its retained
declaration and continuation even if desired config changed. Reusing the
operation ID with another digest conflicts; after terminal `DISABLED`, a
fresh operation reconciles the latest declaration. `DISABLING` has no
cancel/re-enable transition. An enable CAS does not rewrite lifecycle rows or
silently reopen a previously sealed lane. Its bounded receipt/result retains
only the exact profile/lifecycle cut, `resume_required_count`, and canonical
digest of ordered sealed identities. After serving starts, paginated status
lists the currently remaining sealed identities from one manifest snapshot;
its cursor binds that revision and becomes stale instead of mixing pages if
lifecycle moves. Receipt-first replay returns the same bounded original
summary even if lanes later resume; it does not reconstruct the original
identity list. An operator runs ordinary revision-fenced resume for each; a
table with no lifecycle remains eligible for lazy enrollment. `cluster apply`
therefore distinguishes profile enablement from “all enrolled lanes open.”

The lifecycle strand's same-format terminal exit is a distinct two-step offline cluster
management operation, not another meaning of disable or export:
`omnigraph cluster stream retire-for-rebuild plan --graph <id>
--confirm-stream-offline`, followed by `confirm --graph <id>
--retirement-id <uuid> --expected-plan-digest <sha256>
--confirm-stream-offline`. Neither command has an HTTP, direct-`--store`, or
serving-runtime equivalent. Both require `stream_manage`, the stopped-writer
attestation, and the cluster state lock.

Plan remains callable for an enrolled ordinary `DISABLED` graph even if its
streaming declaration was previously unmanaged; the checked cluster
graph/store mapping, stopped-writer attestation, state lock, and
`stream_manage` authorization remain mandatory. It requires every enrolled
lane exactly `SEALED`, every relevant recovery settled, no
acknowledged-but-unfolded cut, exact
PRESENT/base parity, and at least one current `WITHDRAWN` token. Zero
terminal authority uses ordinary export, not irreversible retirement. It
computes one canonical `plan_digest` over source graph identity/internal
format, manifest version and complete live branch-head map, profile revision,
every current binding/lifecycle/sealed proof, and the manifest-selected
pre-retirement `_stream_tokens` `CurrentHeadWitness` (main version plus Lance
transaction UUID; `manifest_e_tag = None`). It streams current dispositions and
counts in bounded batches. It MUST NOT sort, retain, or hash a vector of
current-token rows or ledger history; the immutable selected version binds that
set.

Confirmation supplies that exact `plan_digest`, a non-nil `retirement_id`, and
the authenticated operator. It derives
`operation_request_digest = H(protocol version, plan_digest, authenticated
actor, confirmation intent)` and arms that exact tuple; the retirement ID is
the occurrence key. It recaptures the exact pre-retirement token witness and
all other plan inputs; any pointer or input movement is effect-free
`StreamRetirementPlanChanged`. Current recovery-v19
`StreamAuthorityRetirement` pre-mints the immutable ledger transaction that
appends the receipt and produces the exact receipt-bearing output token
version. The sole manifest CAS revalidates the pre-retirement witness, selects
that output token pointer, advances the profile revision and receipt chain, and
publishes `DISABLED -> RETIRED` with its receipt ID and cut digest. This
control-only CAS appends no ordinary graph-lineage commit and moves no live
branch head; the immutable retirement receipt/profile chain is its audit
record. That is a deliberate exception to ordinary enable/disable lineage, so
the pre-retirement logical cut remains the post-CAS export cut. Its
individually bounded receipt is:

```text
AuthorityRetirementReceipt {
    retirement_id,
    plan_digest,
    operation_request_digest,
    actor,
    source_internal_schema_version,
    source_manifest_version,
    live_branch_heads_digest,
    source_profile_revision,
    lifecycle_and_sealed_proof_digest,
    pre_retirement_token_witness_digest,
    present_token_count,
    withdrawn_token_count,
    export_cut_digest,
    retired_at,
}
```

`export_cut_digest` is the domain-separated digest of the pre-retirement
logical projection—accepted catalog plus the complete live branch-head map and
every table witness reachable from it. It excludes the receipt-only
token/profile pointer advance, avoiding a circular digest while allowing the
post-CAS manifest to reverify the cut. Each later branch export is permitted
only for a member of that frozen map. Its JSONL provenance pairs the unchanged
root receipt with a closed `branch_member` witness containing the canonical
branch name, exact Lance branch identifier, graph head, manifest version,
`table_witness_digest`, and a recomputable `branch_member_digest`. It also
carries `source_schema_ir_hash`, the exact
`ordered_branch_member_digests`, and `selected_member_index`. The loader
recomputes the selected member digest, proves that it occupies the selected
slot, and recomputes the receipt's `export_cut_digest` from the source schema
hash and ordered member digests. `source_schema_ir_hash` is a commitment input
for the retired source cut, not a requirement that it equal the fresh target
graph identity; ordinary loader schema and row validation enforce target
compatibility. The receipt's pre-retirement token witness digest is a
domain-separated hash of the exact pre-retirement `CurrentHeadWitness` plus
the bounded disposition counts, never token-row bytes. V17 requires
`withdrawn_token_count > 0` and has no `DEAD_LETTERED`
vocabulary. Receipt lookup under root-wide occurrence `(graph identity,
AUTHORITY_RETIREMENT, retirement_id)` precedes current-profile comparison, so
a lost terminal response returns the recorded result and
same-ID/different-digest conflicts. Only recovery/finalization of the exact
already-armed retirement sidecar may proceed after its first effect.

Once `RETIRED` is selected, the source is permanently read/export-only at
`export_cut_digest`. Mutation/Load/delete and their `_as` variants, SchemaApply,
BranchMerge, branch create/delete, every profile transition/refinement,
Optimize/EnsureIndices/Repair/Cleanup, and every other graph-content, schema,
branch-ref, profile, lifecycle, recovery, maintenance, writer-claim/fold,
correction, enrollment, or rebind writer refuses before body admission or
effect with
`StreamAuthorityRetired { retirement_id, export_cut_digest }`. Export emits
the exact selected root receipt plus a recomputable, cut-membership-proved
witness for the selected frozen branch member beside each logical artifact.
`RETIRED` export
verifies the profile mode, retirement receipt ID, profile-chain commitment, and
logical-cut match; it trusts that committed cut proof and does not rerun or
override it with the ordinary terminal-token refusal. The receipt is
provenance, not an import of sequencing state: init/load creates a fresh graph
identity; any later enrollment creates a fresh stream incarnation, and a
delayed request carrying the retired incarnation remains effect-free
`StreamBindingChanged`.
The operation never deletes, ages out, rewrites, or labels a `WITHDRAWN` token
`PRESENT`. F3e landed this command, source freeze, recovery-v19 owner, focused
engine/cluster/CLI/export evidence, upgrade guidance, errors, and release-note
contract together. It does not activate the frozen recovery-v14 family. At the
F3e checkpoint correction still refused `WITHDRAW`, so no production path in
that slice created a current `WITHDRAWN` token; F3f now owns that separate
path. The broader lifecycle/dead-letter/
retirement composition matrix remains an F6 integration gate; it does not
weaken the focused F3e proof of irreversible plan/confirm, read/export-only
source boot, and fresh-root rebuild.

Removing `graphs.<id>.streaming` is not a disable transition. F2 changes
cluster planning so removal beside manifest `ENABLED` or `DISABLING` returns
typed `StreamingProfileMustDisableFirst`. The operator first applies explicit
`enabled: false`, lets the retained plan reach terminal `DISABLED`, and only
then uses a second apply to unmanage the declaration. Beside `RETIRED`,
declaration removal is configuration-only and cannot clear or change manifest
authority; any request to enable or otherwise transition/refine the profile
returns `StreamAuthorityRetired`. Server startup also
refuses an absent declaration beside `ENABLED`/`DISABLING`; it never derives a
runtime capability from stale ledger state. For manifest `RETIRED`,
declaration presence or prior unmanagement may mint only the checked
read/query/status/export-only boot capability below, never a fold delegation,
supervisor, admission, mutation, or other stream runtime authority. F2 updates the current operator
documentation that otherwise permits removal to mean “stop managing.”
Unmanaging a terminally disabled declaration does not erase a physical
enrollment, consume its sealed proof, or make direct Mutation/Load valid for
that table; returning to a non-streaming physical format requires the strict
export/init/load rebuild.

The supported production topology has no concurrent first enrollment during
the disable CAS: graceful shutdown settles every admission owner before the
offline apply starts. The local exclusive gate still prevents an owner in the
same process from crossing its durable freeze and is released before per-table
drain, so no table-gate inversion is introduced, but it is not described as a
server/apply fence. V11 replaces the formerly inert v10
`disable_pending_since` slot with
this explicit plan; repeated `StreamingDisablePending` without a durable freeze
is not the protocol. The offline owner and recovery audit the fixed system
actor plus delegation/continuation ID. They do not re-check a mutable user
grant after acknowledgement, and a policy/config refresh cannot strand durable
work or open admission behind disable. Embedded read-only status additively reports profile
mode, disabling operation/revision, and manifest-derived undrained tables; it
does not infer physical progress without the later exclusive-cut status.
Rejected: a server/boot flag (a per-process opinion of a graph-wide property;
restarts and second processes disagree silently) and a cluster-state-only
flag (a direct writer bypassing the serving path would be blind to the
freeze). Cluster-only scope is accepted deliberately: an embedded graph has
no operator, no resident fold driver, and no lifecycle owner.

#### P2 — Enrollment (selected: lazy, graph-wide)

With the profile exactly `ENABLED`, every graph table is stream-eligible; no
per-table opt-in exists. The experimental profile amends §3's standalone
enrollment surface, but not §4.1's exact internal wire incarnation. A table
with no lifecycle is prepared lazily behind the graph adapter:

1. Before body ownership, the checked served entry point captures one
   `StreamGraphIngestWitness` over graph identity, accepted schema identity and
   catalog hash, profile revision, and live fold delegation. It derives the
   opaque graph token described in §4.6. This is the only public prepare
   handshake; an ingest-only actor needs no status permission and the graph is
   the sole Cedar resource.
2. Missing token returns the bodyless `428` challenge. Malformed/stale token or
   authority movement during final recapture returns `412` before polling the
   body and without replacement authority. After the exact token transfers
   body ownership, later schema/profile/delegation or private-lane movement is
   a redacted per-line `stream_authority_changed` stop-tail boundary. There is
   no manual `stream enroll`, public table prepare, or per-table policy
   decision.
3. For each logical node/edge row, the adapter resolves the declaration against
   the captured catalog. An existing `OPEN` lane is reused. For an absent lane,
   the adapter captures the table-scoped eligibility/HEAD evidence and feeds
   the existing §3 recovery-owned prepare using engine-minted enrollment and
   stream-incarnation identities. Concurrent lifecycle creation converges
   through the same one-winner CAS/receipt rules. A successful prepare may
   leave an empty enrolled `OPEN` lane if the request disconnects; the existing
   empty-lane drain path owns its eventual quiesce/disable.
4. The adapter injects the exact private stream incarnation into the internal
   row call. Clients supply only logical declaration, row identity,
   `write_id`, and predecessor token; they neither choose nor observe the lane
   incarnation or binding. Crossing a rebuild/re-enrollment still requires a
   new graph-authority preflight and the caller's deliberate sequencing choice;
   the client never silently reprepares or replays an already-owned body.

Before the table lease, private prepare—an enrollment control rather than a
resident-producing row put—acquires the graph-profile gate shared. Under the
same exclusive table admission lease and existing schema/main/token/table
gates, prepare reruns the recovery barrier and rereads canonical-main
`stream_profile`; the eligibility witness, enabled revision, live
`FoldDelegation`, and checked runtime must all match.
`DISABLED`, `DISABLING`, a changed graph/table identity, ineligibility, or a
delegation mismatch refuses before sidecar or Lance effect; a still-eligible
absent lane with moved HEAD/ref/catalog/profile evidence refuses the graph
request without publishing new authority. Resident-producing ordinary admission retains bounded
preprocessing/inflight ownership, then takes root MemWAL opportunity shared,
graph-profile shared, and table admission before performing the same final
profile/delegation/runtime match and handing off a run. Those permits remain
through invocation, watcher durability, and same-writer fence classification;
a disconnected request transfers them with the bounded invoked tail. The
offline disable owner takes its own process's
gate exclusively only for the first profile CAS and releases it before
per-table drains. The supported production race is closed by the
server-exit/apply-start handoff, not a cross-process lock.

An existing `OPEN` lane may admit; an existing `SEALED` lane returns internal
typed `StreamResumeRequired`, graph-redacted to `stream_authority_changed`, and
never auto-resumes under an ingest actor. The
prepare exchange is binding negotiation hidden by supported clients, not an
operator opt-in: the graph remains one connected model without requiring
external producers to choose which tables participate.

#### P3 — Embedding-bearing tables (selected: caller-supplied vectors)

A streamed row for a table with `@embed` must carry the vector column; a row
missing it is the effect-free per-line `invalid` before any attempt.
Admission validates dimensions; vector-space/model identity is a documented
producer obligation (RFC-012's recorded provider identity is the eventual
validation hook). The admission and fold paths make no external calls,
unchanged from the B1/B2 core. The named future upgrade is server-side
enrichment *before* the put — an opt-in, availability-coupled slower
acknowledgement that keeps fold deterministic. Computing embeddings inside
fold is permanently rejected: fold is the lane's one deterministic,
replayable mechanism and recovery-bound publication proves exact outcomes; an
external provider call cannot re-run exactly.

#### P4 — Fold-time rejection (selected: minimal per-key terminal authority; amends §7 for this profile)

Public acknowledgement cannot be revoked, so fold-time validation has three
outcome classes:

- **data conflicts**—uniqueness, referential integrity, cardinality, and keyed
  row validation—divert one final LWW candidate per losing key while independent
  keys continue;
- **dead-letter envelope overflow**—after valid conflict evidence exists, a
  canonical terminal payload above the selected one-object envelope—publishes
  one durable strict `DataBlock` before canonical-object creation, base-table
  effect, or current-token terminal-disposition transition and no partial fold;
  manifest/token-ledger state may advance to persist the block; and
- **other structural faults**—missing/corrupt authenticated cuts, schema or
  token contradictions, or malformed evidence—fail loudly with no partial
  fold. `DataBlock` v1 cannot authenticate those facts; the driver exposes and
  retries the typed failure, while durable structural parking remains the
  future `AuthorityBlock` contract.

The selected dead-letter protocol is deliberately small:

1. **Current terminal authority.** F5 introduces a versioned
   `DEAD_LETTERED` current-token disposition. Its terminal evidence binds the
   exact occurrence/predecessor, contributor and payload identity, bounded
   reason code, fold operation, object path/digest/length/format, and candidate
   ordinal. The base may remain absent or at its prior visible value; it never
   claims PRESENT parity with the terminal token. A later occurrence must name
   the complete terminal token as predecessor.

2. **One object for one fold.** After deterministic conflict-component and
   final-LWW selection, F5 canonically orders all terminal candidates and
   encodes one NDJSON object under a fixed, measured encoded-byte and peak-RSS
   envelope. One-beyond the envelope installs `DataBlock` before canonical-
   object creation, base-table effect, or current-token terminal-disposition
   transition. F6b4's production-size
   cell pins exact 64-MiB retained encoded capacity and a 192-MiB isolated
   peak-RSS-lift remeasurement tripwire. There is no chunk set, chunk manifest,
   conditional multipart protocol, or per-entry replay checkpoint.

3. **Recovery before object effect.** Before conditional create, the F5
   sidecar owns the authenticated generation cut, canonical candidate
   descriptors, versioned object identity/digest/length/count, exact optional
   base transaction, exact current-token transaction, versioned fold
   attribution, merged-generation result, and terminal manifest row.
   `PutMode::Create` `AlreadyExists` is accepted only after exact
   length/digest verification. Lost PUT outcome remains recovery-owned. An
   unselected object is inert retain-all residue and is never discovered or
   adopted through prefix listing.

4. **One graph-visible decision.** Mixed folds select independent visible
   winners plus current terminal tokens together. An all-diverted fold may
   select token authority, merged-generation progress, fold attribution, and
   the object reference with no base-row effect. The historical v10
   `dead_letter_object` placeholder remains null under v12: its incomplete
   shape is not activated in place; F5 takes a new attribution/recovery format.

5. **Exact retry, ordinary correction.** While a terminal token remains
   current, exact retry of that occurrence returns `dead_lettered` without a
   new object or authority movement. Correction is a fresh ordinary Admission
   occurrence with a new `write_id`, corrected payload, and predecessor equal
   to the terminal token. If it folds successfully, its `PRESENT` token
   becomes current. After that successor, retrying the old occurrence receives
   the normal current-authority conflict. F5 defines no `Replay` row origin,
   replay mutation, replay recovery kind, checkpoint ledger, or replay
   endpoint.

6. **No second dead-letter inventory.** Cluster-only list/export pins the
   manifest-selected token version, streams its one current row per logical key
   in bounded batches, filters `DEAD_LETTERED`, groups object references, and
   emits bounded digest-verified payload pages. It does not prefix-list object
   storage, walk graph history, or maintain a `DeadLetterRecord` chain/hot
   disposition counters. Physical work can grow with uncovered fragments and
   retained history; §4.3/F6 make that an explicit measured EXP gap and define
   the threshold for a future authority-safe reconciler.

7. **Same-format retirement.** Before `DEAD_LETTERED` becomes reachable, the
   same F5 strand extends irreversible cluster-only authority retirement to
   `WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED`. Planning pins the exact sealed graph cut and
   manifest-selected token witness, scans current terminal rows in bounded
   batches, and records scan-derived disposition counts plus a canonical plan
   digest. Actor-bound confirmation is recovery-owned and selects `RETIRED`,
   its immutable receipt, and the exact export cut in one manifest CAS. It
   deletes no dead-letter object and never relabels a terminal token as
   `PRESENT`.

Strict blocks retain §4.4's exact exits: same-cut retry after fixing a transient
cause, reason-gated data correction, or proof-bound authority repair.
Cluster/offline block inspection, correction, repair, payload export, and
retirement remain narrow emergency exits after F7a and receive no served
HTTP/OpenAPI parity. Ingest is the sole activated graph workflow; status,
fold, quiesce, and resume remain later graph-level workflows. The bodyless
graph-authority challenge is part of ingest, while private lane prepare is an
engine detail.

The selected profile adds no new attribution history merely because an object
exists. It reuses the authenticated contributor/payload identity needed for
sequencing and adds only object integrity fields required by recovery and
payload export. Additional per-record principals, provenance commitments, and
public historical listing are deferred until a concrete consumer exists.

#### P5 — Visibility contract (selected: no read-your-writes bridge)

The documented streaming contract is: **an acknowledgement is a durability
receipt, not a visibility receipt** — acknowledged rows become graph-visible
at the next fold or are diverted loudly per P4. The gap is fold cadence
(policy) plus fold duration (physics), typically seconds, with an explicitly
unbounded tail (quiesce, structural block, backlog). This profile exposes no
producer-facing flush/barrier and no fresh reads (Phase E unchanged).
Fold-on-demand exists internally — drain, disable, and quiesce require it —
and as the operator `stream fold` verb under `stream_manage`, which is
lifecycle management, not a producer latency primitive. If experimental usage
demonstrates need, a producer-facing barrier is a thin later addition over
the same mechanism, not a redesign.

#### P6 — Fold scheduling (selected: serial dependency-prioritized driver core)

F5a implements the format-neutral `OPEN` resident subset. One weakly root-scoped
supervisor—not one task per `Omnigraph` handle—triggers `OPEN`-lane folds on
generation-cap pressure and the max-staleness timer. The detached owner creates
a wake immediately after physical put invocation, before its result is known;
cancellation and `AckUnknown` cannot erase it, while passive readiness removes
a no-effect wake. Wakeups coalesce into bounded per-table state; the manifest
and authenticated Lance MemWAL cursor remain work authority. Cold start
discovers `OPEN` backlog and retryable errors back off. After listener bind the
cluster server starts every checked-runtime supervisor; after Axum settles
in-flight requests it fences each root MemWAL opportunity exclusively and then
profile authority exclusively, drops both, and requests/joins each driver. It
then reacquires profile authority and every resident lane's exclusive admission
while aborting writers and joining idle authority owners. One detached cleanup owns that full handoff across caller
cancellation or the shared bounded deadline; failure retains authority
fail-closed. Public health/backlog
projection remains activation work.

F5b0 extends that same exact-`ENABLED`, checked-runtime owner to cold-discover
and continue only unblocked `DRAINING(goal = SEALED)` lanes. It passes the
stored drain ID, expected revision, and initiating actor into the existing
recovery-v14 quiesce owner; it does not retarget `OPEN_AFTER_FOLD`, open a
`SEALED` lane, or create a new occurrence. A selected `DataBlock` is parked
rather than retried hot; exact correction makes the lane eligible again and
the next checked-runtime cold start rediscovers an unblocked goal-`SEALED`
row. Operator fold and the public
status projection are not part of F5b0.

After the serving process exits, checked offline `cluster apply` publishes the
durable `DISABLING` plan before constructing its no-ingress continuation. It
derives one finite lane set from that accepted manifest cut, sorts nodes before
edges and immutable identities within each cohort, owns one lane at a time,
and consumes only the plan's `FoldContinuation`. `OPEN` derives the stable
disable drain, goal-`SEALED` keeps its occurrence, and `OPEN_AFTER_FOLD` is
narrowed exactly once by deterministic `DisableDrainAdoption` through the
existing recovery-v14 lifecycle-receipt owner. It exits after terminal disable
or a loud block. A
serving supervisor never owns a disable-triggered fold and cannot start while
the profile is `DISABLING`; the offline and resident owners never overlap.
When a selected `DataBlock` is encountered, apply retains that exact
`DISABLING` revision in manifest and cluster state and returns its block token
without attempting a later lane. The existing stopped/offline correction plus
an apply rerun reconstructs the same plan and order; it neither mints a second
disable operation nor changes the recorded actor.

The later externally initiated fold carries `fold_operation_id` and uses the
§4.3 management-receipt rules. Implemented timer/cap folds use a distinct
internal system entry point keyed by current table identity and re-prove the
exact binding plus generation cut inside the fold adapter. They rely on
the fold sidecar, merged-generation authority, and replaceable
`LastFoldSummary`; they append no seconds-frequency `ManagementReceipt`.
Both entry points share validation/effect/publication. Automatic timer/cap
folds consume the exact live `FoldDelegation` of `ENABLED` plus matching
`CheckedClusterStreamRuntimeAuthority`. Offline disable folds consume the
`DISABLING` plan's drain-scoped `FoldContinuation` plus checked offline-apply
authority, never runtime authority. The sidecar and attribution bind the
applicable authority ID/profile revision and fixed
`omnigraph:stream-fold` actor. Neither owner fabricates user authorization,
re-checks a mutable user grant after acknowledgement, or grows append-only
lifecycle history on each cadence tick. Reconciliation cannot replace or clear
retained authority until every acknowledged cut is terminal. A missing or
mismatched runtime scope refuses new admission and reports unhealthy; a
missing or mismatched offline scope refuses disable recovery; a fold already
armed under either authority remains recovery-owned.

The fixed profile permits one resident writer and one exclusive fold
root-wide, so it does not claim a simultaneous graph-wide cut. At each
scheduling-round start, F5a freezes only the finite set of
manifest-derived **ready table identities** under one accepted catalog—not
generation cuts, rows, locks, or physical authority. Each identity receives at
most one attempt in that round; work that becomes ready later waits for the
next round. The implemented round visits ready nodes and then ready edges,
carrying a round-robin cursor independently inside both immutable-identity
cohorts, so new work cannot enter and leapfrog an edge already captured in that
finite round. Dependency-level ordering remains a later refinement.

Before every attempt the supervisor refreshes exact manifest authority and
skips a table that is no longer ready. Immediately before validating an edge
cut, it opens the freshly manifest-selected post-node snapshot. A crash derives
a new round from authoritative merged-generation progress and never reapplies a
visible cut. This reduces avoidable RI conflicts but does not promise that an
entity and edges arriving in one wall-clock window fold atomically. Cross-table
skew dead-letters as an ordinary P4 conflict. A true graph-wide cut requires a
future multi-resident memory budget plus a graph admission barrier. Bounded
multi-cycle retry ("grace") remains deferred until measured dead-letter volume
demonstrates need. Upsert-only keeps ordering direction-stable; streamed
deletes remain Phase F.

#### P7 — Manual sealed maintenance (selected: explicit lifecycle-aware bridge)

Persistent quiesce is useful only if `SEALED` can safely support maintenance.
The current generic table-effect gate correctly refuses even `SEALED`: a raw
HEAD move would invalidate lifecycle's witness/proof. Public activation
therefore integrates each sanctioned main-authority writer explicitly.

A same-binding writer extends its recovery plan with the complete prior
`SEALED` row/proof and a bounded allowed effect. Exact-transaction writers may
pre-mint the terminal row. Where the achieved HEAD is not caller-minted,
`EffectsConfirmed` records the exactly classified result; only then does the
writer recompute `verified_empty_digest` over that new base witness while
preserving the authenticated shard cut and current claim receipt. The table
pointer, `CurrentHeadWitness`, proof, and lifecycle revision publish in the
same manifest CAS.

For multi-table content-preserving Optimize or EnsureIndices, the checked
operation acquires every affected stream-admission lease exclusively in sorted
table-identity order as its outermost table gates, retains them through effects
and recovery, and publishes every table pointer and lifecycle update in its one
graph-manifest CAS. It never publishes lifecycle per table. Internal schema
v14/recovery-v16 implements this rule for EnsureIndices; internal schema
v15/recovery-v17 implements the distinct Optimize case. Their doc-hidden
entries require `stream_manage`, an actor, canonical main, an exact retained
`CheckedClusterStreamRuntimeAuthority`, and exact `SEALED` state for every
enrolled productive table. Recovery-v16 layers the complete prior/next SEALED
rows over the existing exact recovery-v8 CreateIndex effects. Recovery-v17
records the complete confirmed Optimize output set and each exact achieved
HEAD. Both re-prove the selected ClaimReceipt from captured token authority
and atomically refresh pointers, both HEAD-witness copies, verified-empty
digests, and lifecycle revisions. Neither writes `_stream_tokens` nor advances
the management-receipt chain. Their ambient forms remain fenced. Productive
SchemaApply is not one of these sanctioned writers, even under terminal
`DISABLED`. It remains refused on an enrolled graph; schema changes use checked
export/rebuild into a fresh graph. A same-schema physical rebind stays
`SEALED` and completes recovery-covered `stream_rebind` with a fresh
enrollment, binding-scope ID, and shard namespace. Rebind retains the old
binding/claim receipts, installs a new `BindingReceipt`, scoped initial
fence-only `ClaimReceipt`, current receipt ID, and freshly verified empty proof,
and publishes the new binding as **`SEALED`** without admitting a writer or
put. Its new epoch is ordered only within the fresh scope. A separate
`StreamResume` must then claim a higher same-scope epoch and perform
`SEALED -> OPEN`; rebind itself never opens admission.

Mutation/Load and BranchMerge remain refused because moving logical contents
without a third token-aware sequencing transition would obsolete
`_stream_tokens` authority.
Cleanup, drift repair/adoption, force-repair, drop/re-add, and incompatible
rematerialization also remain refused unless their dedicated
retention/adoption/rebind proof is implemented; the same-binding bridge does
not authorize content writes, deletion, or adoption. There is no generic
`allow sealed` switch. Native branch-ref controls keep their existing sealed
exception, but a named graph branch prevents bounded resume. Automatic
operation-scoped drain remains Phase D. The implemented private compositions
are explicit `quiesce -> checked-runtime EnsureIndices -> resume` and
`quiesce -> checked-runtime Optimize -> resume`; served maintenance, the
production physical-rebind handoff, and the fresh-target schema-rebuild
workflow remain later work.

Production ownership is part of P7, not left to an ambient engine caller.
Same-binding EnsureIndices and Optimize already execute only through the serving process's
retained `CheckedClusterStreamRuntimeAuthority`, require every affected lane
already be exactly `SEALED`, and otherwise refuse before an effect. Their
eventual F7 surfaces are
`POST /graphs/{graph_id}/maintenance/optimize`,
`POST /graphs/{graph_id}/maintenance/ensure-indices`,
remote `optimize --server`, and
`maintenance ensure-indices --server`. They do not automatically start an
operation-scoped drain. Graph-wide maintenance is deliberately not a durable
single-lane management occurrence: it accepts no caller operation ID and
creates no lifecycle ManagementReceipt. Exact recovery settles an armed
physical plan before a retry replans against current authority; EnsureIndices'
convergent planner then makes no-work and delayed retries naturally idempotent.
A true no-work invocation creates no sidecar, graph lineage, or lifecycle
successor. F7 supplies actor/policy/transport ownership without adding a token
receipt framework.

A same-schema physical rebind does not rely on an operator-timed
quiesce/shutdown gap. It follows `graceful server shutdown -> offline disable
to terminal DISABLED -> cluster apply --confirm-stream-offline -> separate
enable apply -> server restart -> explicit resume`. The durable disable plan
captures and drains any prepare, put, or resume that won before transport
closed. Only after terminal `DISABLED` may the apply process hold the mandatory
cluster state lock and mint `CheckedClusterMaintenanceAuthority` bound to the
exact disabled profile revision, validated declaration, and graph/store
mapping. It then runs the graph-global recovery barrier before any rebind
effect. Only after every enrollment, writer-claim, fold, lifecycle, and
maintenance sidecar settles—and any ordinary cold-WAL reopen/reconstruction is
classified—does it release and reacquire gates from the root, recapture sealed
authority, and permit the physical rebind. It revalidates every sealed proof
and leaves rebound lanes `SEALED`. Re-enable is a distinct offline apply that
exits before server restart. Productive SchemaApply remains refused on an
enrolled graph; schema evolution freezes a checked sealed/retired export and
initializes and loads a fresh graph under the desired schema. The existing
operation's Cedar action and `stream_manage` are both required. Any drain
blocked on `DataBlock` uses only F3f's offline `cluster
stream block show|correct --confirm-stream-offline` controls under that same
sole-writer handoff. Future `AuthorityBlock` repair must use a distinct
reason-gated owner under the same handoff. EXP has no served HTTP
block-inspection, correction, or authority-repair route.
Raw direct `--store` maintenance has neither capability and refuses.

F6b1 has landed the lower/control-authority and engine half of the planned
two-stage stream-aware export seam. An exact managed `DISABLED | RETIRED`
applied row, or exact graph/state evidence which the engine accepts only for
unmanaged `RETIRED` or enrolled `DISABLED`, can mint only
`CheckedClusterServedExportAuthority`, sharing the one process-local serving
registration without gaining writer authority. Retirement confirmation
CAS-converges a managed row to its exact `RETIRED` revision and refresh
preserves that declaration identity. Its doc-hidden capture method nonwaitingly
reserves the exclusive root export gate, settles recovery, and closes profile
plus sorted admission/schema/branch/token/table
gates while it validates terminal authority, prevalidates filters, and freezes
the accepted catalog, selected snapshot's exact Lance table versions, and
retired provenance. It releases those gates only into a private-field,
non-cloneable `StreamExportCut`. The cut retains the checked authority and
exclusive root gate through consuming output, so later writer movement cannot
retarget it; branch create/create-from/delete, schema apply, cleanup, and
supported graph-root deletion take the shared side and cannot remove or reuse a
selected path/version until the cut is consumed or dropped.
Ambient `Omnigraph::export_jsonl[_to_writer]`, embedded SDK, and direct
`--store` export of an enrolled ordinary `DISABLED` graph return
`StreamingRequiresClusterRuntime` before any byte. The existing
receipt-verified `RETIRED` ambient route remains a compatibility rebuild bridge
alongside F6b5's checked served route and owns the same exclusive root gate
through output. Under an ordinary
`DISABLED` profile, current terminal token authority returns
`StreamExportBlocked` before output; a post-start storage/writer failure remains
that stream error. No format or recovery grammar changed.

F6b5 now owns `POST /graphs/{graph_id}/export`, `export --server`, and the
public export half. Before constructing a response or sending HTTP `200`, the
served route authorizes, reserves its complete queue/producer/consumer envelope
under a bounded deadline, and captures the checked cut. Preflight and slot
refusal remain ordinary typed JSON before headers; exact Lance versions scan
incrementally using approximate batch targets and feed a strict bounded chunk
queue; a stalled receiver backpressures production; and completion, disconnect,
and error release every reservation. The queue/root limits and
preflight/stall/disconnect handler cells
co-land with HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI export parity. F7a later activates public
graph row ingress, F7b graph-redacted checked status, and F7c selector-free
graph-wide resume plus checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize. Per-declaration
lifecycle/abort/rebind and direct SDK control remain staged.
The resulting artifact may initialize a fresh target through normal cluster
control, never load over the enrolled source.

#### Surface retained, trimmed, and non-trimmable

Retained from §4.6: the graph-authority ETag handshake plus graph-native NDJSON
`ingest` with its redacted per-line response union and ordering/cancellation
rules (plus P4's `dead_lettered` terminal result); full
status needed by lifecycle and operations; operator `fold`; persistent
revision-fenced `quiesce` and `resume`; post-`SEALED` rebuild preflight;
stream-aware export and same-binding maintenance; and the `stream_ingest` /
`stream_manage` Cedar split. Narrow cluster/offline support owns current
dead-letter list/payload export, block inspection/data correction, exact
authority repair, and authority retirement. These emergency exits do not
receive served HTTP/OpenAPI parity; payload export additionally requires
`export`. Trimmed by this profile: the standalone
operator `enroll` verb/per-table opt-in (not prepare's retry identity),
producer-facing per-token barriers, fresh reads, and configurable per-stream
policy. Non-trimmable regardless of experimental status: Cedar enforcement,
typed bounded failures, shutdown ownership, durable attribution, terminal
dead-letter sequencing, safe export, OpenAPI/parity/failpoint/genuine-rebuild
evidence, and the no-raw-GC boundary. Because this profile is cluster-only, the
server-owned runtime, HTTP/OpenAPI, remote `GraphClient`, and remote CLI for
each workflow activate together only after its hidden path and acceptance
evidence pass. F7a does so for graph ingress without activating management.
Ambient embedded SDK and direct `--store` mutation remain a
typed `StreamingRequiresClusterRuntime` refusal before body/effect; embedded
manifest-only status remains. The experimental designation is also an explicit
Hyrum boundary: acknowledgement and P4/P5 terminal semantics are committed,
while fold cadence, dead-letter object layout, and status field shapes are
declared unstable.

By the time F7 executes, F2 will already have landed
`cluster apply --confirm-stream-offline` and its profile adapter, and F6b5 will
already own exact-terminal served export. F7a co-lands the graph row route,
remote command, challenge/error DTOs, authorization tests, and OpenAPI contract
over the existing candidate runtime. It deliberately leaves lifecycle,
maintenance, and checked-status transport to later F7 slices. Export remains
the earlier narrow HTTP/remote exception.

F7b later activates checked status, and F7c activates only graph-wide resume
and checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize. Per-declaration lifecycle/abort,
rebind, and direct SDK control remain inactive.

The F7a activation PR extends F2's already-public cluster-ownership,
direct-mutation-refusal, and v10→v11 rebuild baseline with the activated stream
operating contract. CLI reference, server, policy, and error docs add the
graph-token/ingest handshake, authorization, tagged redacted results, and the stream/export-specific extension of the
served-only/direct-refusal boundary. Cluster docs separately cover the narrow
offline dead-letter, correction, authority-repair, and retirement exits.
Later maintenance docs show exact
`quiesce -> served Optimize/EnsureIndices -> resume`; cluster and upgrade docs
show the distinct `graceful stop -> offline disable to terminal DISABLED ->
cluster-state-locked physical rebind -> separate enable -> restart -> explicit
resume` and checked-export -> fresh-init/load schema-change workflows. The
latter includes safe served export with the old-format binary from an exact
pinned sealed cut before cutover and init/load into a fresh target rather than
in-place import. The constants
reference publishes every activated measured F6/F7 row/byte/count/time default:
ingress line/run/root ownership, preprocessing, fold/dead-letter single-object
byte and RSS envelopes, driver cadence/backoff, bounded current-terminal scan
pages, export slot/queue/deadline, and shutdown bounds. No active safety
workflow or default remains internal-only.

Logical export has exactly two admissible source profiles:

1. ordinary `DISABLED`, with exact `SEALED` proof, token/base parity, and a
   bounded streamed proof of zero current non-`PRESENT` token authority; or
2. `RETIRED`, with an exact selected authority-retirement receipt,
   profile-chain commitment, and matching recorded logical cut.

The second case trusts the committed retirement cut and does not rerun the
ordinary terminal-token rejection. Dead-letter payload export is an inspection
artifact, not an import contract. In the first case terminal authority returns
typed `StreamExportBlocked`. An exact retry returns the recorded
`DEAD_LETTERED` result only while that token remains current. Repair is a fresh
ordinary correction that publishes a `PRESENT` successor; no special replay
origin or checkpoint protocol exists. A fresh accepted successor may replace
either terminal disposition, but no absence-preserving successor clears
`WITHDRAWN`. Authority retirement intentionally resets sequencing only through
init/load into a fresh graph identity; any later enrollment creates a fresh
stream incarnation. It never resumes the source or pretends a terminal token
is `PRESENT`. Lossless terminal-authority transfer still requires a future
stream-aware export/import format. The experimental rebuild never silently
omits an acknowledged terminal.

#### Pre-implementation audit and evidence gates

The first audit produced v10's enablement row and an explicit-null dead-letter
placeholder that is now frozen. Further lifecycle/recovery vocabulary and P4's terminal token state
each follow the strand rule: assume a new format until an audit proves exact
old-binary refusal is already guaranteed; bundle known vocabulary before
shipping; never reuse one version number for two incompatible payload shapes.

Evidence required before any public ingest surface ships extends existing
owners rather than creating a parallel suite. It covers failpoints through
acknowledgement, every claim/lifecycle/maintenance boundary, both fold
participants, the one dead-letter object's recovery-owned publication, and the
sole manifest decision. F6b3's landed long-history cells report exact selected
uncovered token fragments and measure fixed-cardinality current-token hit/miss
and terminal-page scan cost; they do not query receipt keys or claim
history-flat or covered behavior. F6b7 adds the paired failpoints-only selected-
index current-token and receipt-key comparison, including maintenance
amortization and semantic-equivalence proofs. It is not production recovery;
its bounded NO-GO applies only to the uncompacted profile-cycle fixture and
schedules no standalone reconciler. Evidence reopens at greater depth, after a
Lance/index-grammar change, or before considering graph-manifest-compacted or
checked-Optimize-coupled maintenance.
Sealing proves it reads only the current WAL-tail delta. Historical
recovery-v12 ordinary-fold bytes retain their meaning and are refused under
v12. Current cells crash v13 `StreamProfileChange` around its exact
profile-receipt transaction and manifest CAS, and crash recovery-v14
ordinary/drain folds at both participants plus
`StreamLifecycleReceipt(QuiesceFinalize)` around its ledger transaction and
sole manifest CAS. They prove folds preserve the selected claim/tail commitment
without appending a claim receipt and that only the exact receipt/lifecycle
pair becomes authoritative. The registered `DisableDrainAdoption` subkind
receives the same exact-ledger proof; other v14 lifecycle families remain
fail-closed until activated.

F5 adds mixed and all-diverted folds, exact retry while the terminal token is
current, a fresh ordinary correction that publishes a `PRESENT` successor,
one-under/exact/one-over object-cap cells, worst-case JSON expansion, and
recovery crashes before object PUT, after a lost PUT response, and before the
manifest decision. `AlreadyExists` is accepted only after exact length and
digest verification; mismatch is typed refusal. An all-diverted fold proves
that no base effect is required, no intermediate token version becomes
authority, and a retry cannot duplicate the object. Current-terminal listing
uses bounded batches against the selected token version. Retirement records
its exact cut and then permits rebuild without pretending the old terminal
authority became `PRESENT`.

F6b4 adds the isolated production-size closure over that existing behavior.
Its 8,192-candidate encoder/verifier cell pins exact one-under/cap/one-over
bytes, retained encoded capacity, encode/verify time, and paired peak RSS. The
real overflow integration separately proves the durable operational
`DataBlock` lands before canonical-object, base-table, or current-token
terminal-disposition transition, permits only the manifest/token-ledger movement
needed to record that block, and leaves no recovery sidecar or partial fold.

The remaining evidence covers prepare witness/actor/lost-response/no-body
ordering; concurrent first prepare and first writers; stale incarnation and
authority movement; shutdown and transport-close races; cross-process
profile-CAS recovery; physical-rebind refusal before terminal `DISABLED`;
productive SchemaApply refusal plus checked fresh-target rebuild;
capability construction and revocation; startup mismatch refusal; bounded
ingress/reorder/output ownership; disable convergence; pinned-cut safe export
and backpressure; served/remote DTO parity; `forbidden_apis`; genuine rebuild;
and sustained throughput plus fresh/long-history acknowledgement cost with
retained-metadata and uncovered-index-tail terms reported separately.

CI follows the repository's sustainable policy rather than carrying a second
dependency-build system. Ordinary PR checks always report and use a
conservative docs-only classifier; authors record the exact relevant local
commands and results in the PR. The protected post-merge run owns the full
workspace, predecessor-format, RustFS, failpoint, and expensive streaming
matrix. A red protected branch is a stop-line signal: further merges wait for
repair or an explicit documented maintainer override. A stream-specific
required PR check is introduced only after a genuinely isolated harness has a
measured cold-run budget; a cache or cross-PR artifact is never a correctness
dependency.

## 5. Ack-path validation and writer lifecycle

Before append, OmniGraph applies checks that need no base-table read: Arrow
shape/type, required/default fields, enum/range/check constraints, reserved
columns, explicit non-null `id`, and stream mode. Streaming never reuses the
loader's random-ID fallback because retry safety depends on stable caller-owned
identity. RI, cardinality, and cross-version uniqueness remain fold-time work.
The private B1 seam accepts the exact already-normalized physical schema;
vector values, when present, are ordinary physical columns supplied before
acknowledgement. B1 does not call an external embedding provider or synthesize
unspecified fold-derived fields. Any future derivation step requires its own
contract and evidence and must complete before the one bounded table effect.

B2 adds one mandatory recovery prelude before any writer claim: under stream
admission it resolves or refuses every pending claim/recovery operation relevant
to the binding. B2a has no reservation or physical-inventory prelude. B2b must
additionally resolve the Lance claim/reclaim/checkpoint attempts from §4.5.2.
Mutating entry points finish the sole exact pending authority plan or refuse,
while read-only status reports it. Under B2b, patched Lance also refuses
`mem_wal_writer` while a substrate attempt remains pending. No token check,
same-key queue, or final pre-put gate can bypass this recovery prelude after
restart.

Phase B1 admits exactly one non-empty normalized `RecordBatch` per Lance
`put_no_wait`. Each call and the **entire active generation**, including any
duplicate batch submitted while that live generation is still active, are
capped at 8,192 rows and 32 MiB of logical dense-slice Arrow bytes. The charged
representation is the selected slice after normalization/defaulting and internal
`_tombstone=false` injection; backing-buffer capacity and physical allocation
are deliberately excluded. These are hard OmniGraph reservations made before
the row put and use the sealed keyed writer's numeric limits; they are not
Lance's soft thresholds. Cheap raw row/byte bounds reject obviously over-cap
input before recovery I/O; a raw-fit batch then receives exact post-tombstone
validation at that same pre-recovery boundary. An exact batch above either
per-call limit is terminal `ResourceLimitExceeded` in private B1 and maps to
per-line `stream_input_too_large` or bounded adapter chunking in B2; it is never
`FoldRequired`. After any recovery/authority
prelude, the exact charge is recomputed and reserved against the aggregate
budget. Every put then follows one order: exact charge, shared admission,
same-key input queue, and finally worker-mode inspection. A queue-first fast
path is forbidden because the fair admission lock can otherwise form an
owner/fold/waiter cycle. This all happens before detached ownership, cold
claim, or `put_no_wait`.

Replayed residue is never admitted back into a live generation: it is routed
to the fold-only path described below. Cold classification installs that
fold-only marker and the exact recovered accounting before it releases the
opener's queue position. New calls then receive `FoldRequired` before adding a
charge. Callers charged before the replay became observable drain normally;
their buffers can make the honest ledger transiently exceed the nominal root
cap, so the worker does not wait for root-wide budget convergence while it
still holds shared admission. A legal batch that fits an empty generation but
would cross either **remaining** generation budget returns typed `FoldRequired`
without calling `put_no_wait` or adding a row/WAL batch. A configured
`durable_write=true` writer must return a durability watcher; `None` after
invocation is `AckUnknown` plus writer retirement, never acknowledgement.
Watcher success proves that the submitted batch crossed Lance's durability
boundary, but it is not by itself a clean acknowledgement. Before returning
`DurableBatchAck`, private B1 runs `check_fenced()` on that same
`ShardWriter`. Fence loss, an inability to read the epoch, a failed owner task,
or a check that does not settle before the invocation deadline is
post-invocation `AckUnknown`; the worker retires and preserves possible durable
residue for conservative replay.

The private success value is deliberately status-only:

```text
DurableBatchAck {
  table_identity,
  enrollment_id,
  shard_id,
  writer_epoch,
  caller_ordinal_range,
  row_count,
}
```

It contains no generation, WAL entry, or batch-position coordinate. The typed
post-invocation `AckUnknown` outcome carries enough of the same binding and
caller ordinal context to report the ambiguity, but makes no durability claim.
RC.1 cannot later attribute replayed residue to that specific attempt, so the
attempt remains permanently ambiguous even when replay preserves its possible
effect. This is the implemented B1 shape. B2 adds the logical `write_id`,
opaque predecessor/result tokens, trusted contributor, payload digest, and server-minted
`admission_attempt_id` inside the stored row as specified by §4.1. That evidence
does not turn RC.1's watcher into a physical receipt; it lets an explicit retry
enforce current/non-current sequencing without blindly appending stale data.

One root-scoped registry is singleflight for the exact physical binding across
all `Omnigraph` handles in the process; it is never handle-local. Its serialized
per-binding worker owns the final authority check, generation-budget
reservation, the call to `put_no_wait`, and the watcher wait. This is required
because RC.1 may insert into the MemTable and then return `Err` while scheduling
the WAL flush. The worker, not the request task, therefore determines the
outcome after invocation.

The registry has idle eviction and hard global/per-table limits for resident
writer count, reserved normalized generation bytes, in-flight calls, and
pending generations. Per-actor inflight accounting starts with B2's
authenticated public caller. Exceeding a bound backpressures with a typed
retryable response; it never drops a row. RC.1's public MemTable estimate omits
some PK-index memory, so OmniGraph does not mislabel it a hard total-RSS bound;
actual index/RSS overhead is an evidence gate and remains observable.

Eviction waits for every OmniGraph-owned durability waiter; if that cannot be
proved, affected calls become `AckUnknown`. Retirement first closes the
serialized worker to new puts, then calls public `ShardWriter::abort` and awaits
its already-active handler through one background-owned abort task retained in
the retired registry entry. The caller deadline bounds waiting for that task;
it never cancels or drops the abort future. This matters because RC.1
`shutdown_all` takes the handler join handles before awaiting them—cancelling
that future can detach an active handler and make a later abort look empty. The
entry is removed only after the original abort completion settles. A deadline
keeps it retired and admission closed and returns typed `RecoveryRequired`; B1
never issues a second abort or reopens beside a possibly active handler. A
process restart reclassifies the durable state before admission. The
caller-quiesce precondition is
structurally guarded. B1 never uses `ShardWriter::close` for retirement and
never treats `close() == Ok(())` as durability evidence. That posture is
independent of the upstream contract, which tightened at the Lance 9.0.0 bump:
through 9.0.0-rc.1 `close` discarded final WAL/frozen-flush completion errors
and returned a false `Ok(())`, while 9.0.0 (upstream #7769) propagates them.
The stricter contract can only surface failures B1 already fails closed on. The private implementation has
explicit resident-writer, reservation, eviction, and durability-deadline
values, but their promotion as product defaults remains gated on the checked-in
RSS/latency/backpressure evidence in §12.3. Lance's soft
post-insert thresholds and potentially unbounded backpressure wait are not
credited as OmniGraph hard resource limits.

RC.1's durability watermark is writer-wide while MemTable batch positions
restart at zero after `freeze_memtable`. A watcher for generation `N + 1` can
therefore resolve from generation `N`'s old watermark. B1 does not use that
surface across rollover. Its bounded configuration prevents automatic
rollover: `max_memtable_batches=8,193` sits one above the worst-case 8,192
non-empty one-row calls, while `max_memtable_size` and
`max_unflushed_memtable_bytes` are fixed to a portable 1 GiB.
`max_memtable_rows=8,193` is also explicit and persisted, but RC.1 uses it to
size HNSW structures rather than as a MemTable rollover trigger, so the proof
does not credit it. MemTable mode stays on and maintained indexes
stay empty; a widest-legal normalized generation guard proves Lance's trigger
estimate—BatchStore bytes plus the PK Bloom filter—cannot reach either byte
threshold. RC.1 omits the mandatory PK index from that estimate, so its actual
memory is covered only by the separate RSS evidence gate, never by the hard
32-MiB logical dense-slice Arrow reservation. The worker explicitly seals and drains its one
generation, retires that writer without admitting into the
replacement MemTable, folds the generation, then reopens the binding at a
higher epoch before the next put. An observed automatic rollover is
corruption/refusal, not a second watcher domain. An adversarial surface guard
delays generation `N + 1`'s WAL PUT after sealing `N` and proves the pinned RC.1
bug; adapter tests prove no B1 path can issue that second-generation put on the
same writer.

Before the first put, configuration is split into three explicit classes:

1. binding/correctness identity — topology, `durable_write=true`, MemTable on,
   empty maintained-index set, WAL buffer policy, and the no-auto-roll
   generation envelope/capacities; these are persisted, hashed, and read back;
2. OmniGraph-owned runtime policy — persistence retry/backoff, registry and
   deadline bounds, backpressure, logging, and statistics; these are explicit
   constants and metrics but changing them does not pretend to re-enroll the
   physical stream; and
3. injected runtime capabilities — the root's shared Lance `Session`, the
   base's store parameters when present, and `warmer=None`; these are validated
   at construction and are not scalar enrollment identity.

Compatible-looking RC defaults are never inferred. B1 bumps the persisted
stream configuration from v1 to v2 and the graph-format capability from
internal schema v7 to v8; its `StreamFold` recovery envelope is schema v11.
Phase-A v7/config-v1 roots contain no publicly acknowledged rows and are
refused rather than adopted in place; they move through export/init/load into
a different root.

The RC.1 audit records the currently implicit fields so none disappear during
implementation: `durable_write`; 10-MiB WAL buffer; 100-ms opportunistic WAL
flush interval; three WAL-persist retries with 50-ms base delay; 256-MiB /
100,000-row / 8,000-batch MemTable defaults; manifest-scan batch size two;
1-GiB unflushed threshold; 30-second backpressure logging; synchronous-index,
10,000-row / one-second async-index, and 60-second stats-log fields; zero
frozen-MemTable grace; MemTable enabled; empty HNSW overrides; and no warmer.
The shared `Session` and the base's store parameters when present are injected
runtime capabilities rather than persisted scalar defaults. B1 explicitly
sets each applicable field and either identity-binds it under class 1, owns it
under class 2, or proves it semantically inactive on the pinned code path.
In RC.1, `sync_indexed_write`, the async-index fields, and
`stats_log_interval` have no production reads; they are still pinned explicitly
rather than described as active controls. `max_wal_flush_interval` is checked
only opportunistically during a put, not by a background timer, and durable
`put_no_wait` queues an immediate flush. The actual WAL handler always joins
the WAL append with every IndexStore update—including the mandatory PK
BTree—and the watcher advances only after that join. The audit values are
inventory, not automatically accepted OmniGraph limits.

The root-scoped worker registry is keyed by the exact
`(stable_table_id, incarnation_id, enrollment_id, shard_id)` binding. That is
a worker identity, **not** an admission-lock key. The outer process-local
admission lease reuses Phase A's one common `StreamAdmissionKey` domain,
`(stable_table_id, incarnation_id, resolved_physical_ref)`, where a missing
physical ref means main. `enrollment_id` and `shard_id` are revalidated under
that lease but never partition its lock domain. Every affected path for the
same table/ref—including ordinary graph writers that can move the base-table
HEAD, MemWAL append, fold, enrollment, drain, and stream recovery—must acquire
this same domain in its specified shared or exclusive mode; no enrollment- or
shard-keyed admission lock may be introduced beside it. Multiple shard-specific
workers may overlap only while holding shared leases on that common table/ref
domain, so an exclusive enrollment, drain, fold, or recovery waits for all of
them and for any ordinary writer.

Every admitted call, including one using an already-warm writer, first runs the
synchronous recovery barrier and resolves or refuses every stream recovery
kind relevant to this binding/authority before capturing `OPEN`, the complete
physical binding, `CurrentHeadWitness`, and that shard's epoch floor. B1's set
is `StreamEnrollment` plus `StreamFold`; B2 adds resume/abort-drain, and Phase D
adds rebind. A later format cannot silently reuse B1's shorter list. Stream
recovery keeps admission exclusively closed. Cold open, higher-epoch
reopen/replay, and a warm writer's final check all acquire the same shared
root-scoped admission lease **before** any `mem_wal_writer` claim. Under that
lease it first repeats the relevant-sidecar barrier and revalidates `OPEN`, the
binding/witness, exact graph-branch topology, and epoch floor from fresh
authority. If recovery is required, it releases shared admission, resolves the
intent under the exclusive recovery path, and restarts; it never claims from a
stale pre-lease capture. The lease is held through claim/replay validation and
either the complete put/watcher outcome or the quiesced abort-retirement
sequence. After a claim, and again immediately before **every** put, the worker
re-lists relevant sidecars and re-reads the lifecycle row, physical base HEAD,
and shard status: no relevant intent may exist, the binding and witness must
still be identical, state must still be `OPEN`, the shard must be active, and
the claimed epoch must exceed the recorded floor for that same shard. A
mismatch retires the writer through the quiesced `abort` sequence and returns a
typed retry without appending.

The bounded profile closes both the claim-to-check and check-to-put races with
that process-local lease. Drain takes it exclusively, so it cannot capture an
epoch floor while a cold claimant is advancing the shard and merely waiting to
run its final check. Drain waits out existing acknowledgement/retirement work
and keeps admission closed through `DRAINING` and `SEALED`. On restart, a
lifecycle state other than `OPEN` is reconstructed as closed before requests
are served. This is valid only because the support boundary excludes an
overlapping writer process; the lease is not advertised as distributed
fencing.

The complete invocation and durability wait are owned independently of the
requesting task so client cancellation cannot drop the lease or abandon an
unknown append. Success is returned only after
`BatchDurableWatcher::wait()` yields `Ok(())` **and** the same
`ShardWriter::check_fenced()` then yields `Ok(())`. A validation, authority,
budget, or queue failure before invoking `put_no_wait` is row-effect-free
rejection; epoch claim/replay evidence may already exist. Once invocation
starts, `put_no_wait Err`, a missing watcher, cancellation, deadline, fence,
persistence error, watcher failure, or post-durability fence-read/task
ambiguity without successful completion is typed `AckUnknown`; the writer is
retired and reopen/replay preserves any durable residue without claiming which
attempt produced it. A private deadline is explicit but provisional. B2
selects a public deadline only after the Phase-B1 instrument is accepted;
Lance's unrelated commit timeout is not reused.

The general multi-process profile still requires the substrate admission seal:
after `DRAINING`, later claims must be refused across processes and existing
writers fenced before a post-check put. The exact upstream seal/reopen surface
therefore remains the expansion gate, even if Gate E0 accepts the bounded
profile.

Initial topology has one active ingest owner for each `(graph, table, main)`
shard and one live writer process for the graph. MemWAL's epoch fence permits a
crash successor to replay after external exclusivity; it is not a load
balancer, a distributed OmniGraph recovery fence, or permission for two server
replicas to overlap. Multi-replica routing/failover waits for the multi-shard
phase plus an accepted ownership protocol.

Phase B1 replaces Phase A's empty-epoch-1-only compatible-open validator before
the first put. Reopening the exact binding claims a higher epoch and replays
durable WAL state. Persisted validation uses the authoritative
`replay_after_wal_entry_position`, exact shard-manifest topology/generations,
and base `merged_generations`; `wal_entry_position_last_seen` is only a
read-side hint. Current and frozen MemTables are runtime state and are not
invented from the persisted shard manifest. The active validator accepts only
the bound shard's valid monotonic epoch, authoritative replay cursor,
generation topology, and merge progress for the exact configuration and
current witness; a foreign shard, binding/config mismatch, invalid status,
unexplained authoritative cursor regression, or corruption still fails closed.
Gate E0's rule that data or cursor movement is invalid remains the enrollment
classifier only and must not be reused as an active-stream validator.

Reopen has an exact fail-closed routing table before any put:

1. no unmerged flushed generation plus an empty active MemTable may admit;
2. no unmerged flushed generation plus a non-empty replayed active MemTable is
   fold-only and admits no put;
3. exactly one unmerged flushed generation plus an empty active MemTable is
   fold-only and resumes that generation;
4. an unmerged flushed generation plus non-empty active data, more than one
   unmerged generation, any frozen MemTable, an unexpected generation number,
   or replay beyond the 8,192-row/32-MiB logical dense-slice cap fails closed.

This is stricter than merely rebuilding a reservation. In pinned RC.1,
`replay_memtable_from_wal` inserts the replayed batches into a fresh
`BatchStore` but does not advance that store's per-MemTable WAL-flush
watermark. A later put or plain `force_seal_active` therefore re-appends and
re-indexes the replayed prefix. Repeating a crash after that WAL PUT but before
the shard-manifest commit can multiply the replay tail until the fixed batch
capacity is exhausted.

B1 does not wait for an upstream release. Under the exclusive fold lease, case
2 snapshots public `in_memory_memtable_refs`, requires `frozen` to be empty and
the active range to be exactly the authoritatively replayed contiguous prefix,
then calls public `BatchStore::set_max_flushed_batch_position(len - 1)` before
`force_seal_active`. Every marked batch was just read successfully from durable
WAL; RC.1 already seeds the writer's covered-WAL cursor to the replay tip, so
the resulting generation stamps that exact cursor without writing the rows to
WAL or the PK index again. The adapter then drains, retires, and folds before
another put. This RC.1 compatibility bridge is isolated, source-guarded, and
removed when Lance initializes the replayed BatchStore watermark itself; it is
not a second WAL implementation.

Generation reservation is restart-derived, not a drifting runtime counter.
After claim/replay the worker snapshots `active.batch_store` and sums every
stored batch's rows plus each array's `ArrayData::get_slice_memory_size()` in
the same post-tombstone logical representation charged pre-put. An empty
admissible reopen
starts at zero; a non-empty result is validated against the hard cap and routed
to fold-only, never used to continue admission. The serialized worker updates
the derived total after each completed invocation while that one live
generation remains open. Surface guards pin `in_memory_memtable_refs`, public
BatchStore iteration/StoredBatch data, the watermark bridge, and accounting for
replayed duplicates; Lance's different `MemTableStats::estimated_size` and
backing-buffer capacity are not substituted for the 32-MiB logical contract.

## 6. Fold protocol

Phase B1 exposes one explicit private strict fold; there is no background
scheduler. It acquires the admission lease exclusively for the complete cut,
waits for admitted durability watchers, calls `force_seal_active`, waits for
`wait_for_flush_drain`, and captures the resulting immutable flushed-generation
cut. It immediately retires the writer and never admits a put into the empty
replacement MemTable created by sealing. This temporary same-process cut is
not the durable `DRAINING`/`SEALED` operator barrier from §8.

Seal and drain are background-owned, bounded-wait operations. RC.1 replaces the active MemTable before
all flush scheduling can report success, and its handler/channel or object-
store work can stall. The registry task—not the requesting future—owns the
seal/drain/abort sequence and the exclusive admission lease until it settles.
Before a cold fold invokes the writer opener, it atomically reserves one
resident slot, one pending generation, the full 32-MiB logical generation budget, and
the same-key fold-only marker. The opener runs in an owned task and is awaited
under the same seal deadline used by the later cut. A caller timeout never
cancels that task: the continuation retains the opener, exclusive authority,
in-flight permit, full reservation, and `Opening` slot until it can transfer
them to the claimed writer or prove that no writer was claimed. An opener join
failure, slot transition, or reservation-transfer ambiguity retains all
possible ownership forever and fails closed.

Any `force_seal_active` error is therefore generation-
effect-ambiguous: B1 closes the worker, starts the quiesced abort/reopen
classifier, and returns typed `RecoveryRequired` rather than claiming no
effect. Evidence-selected deadlines bound only the caller's wait. A deadline
keeps the original task and abort completion retained, the registry entry
retired, and admission closed; it does not cancel a Lance future, claim
quiescence, arm `StreamFold`, retry abort, or reopen beside the unresolved
handler.

`wait_for_flush_drain() == Ok(())` is not sufficient evidence on pinned RC.1.
The flush handler removes a completed watcher on both success and failure, so a
waiter that starts after a fast failed handler can observe an empty watcher
queue and return success. After the wait, B1 atomically re-reads
`in_memory_memtable_refs`, requires `frozen` to be empty, and independently
requires the authoritative latest shard manifest to contain the exact expected
generation and covered replay cursor. A retained frozen MemTable, absent or
mismatched generation, or cursor mismatch retires the writer and re-enters the
§5 fold-only classifier or fails closed; it never arms `StreamFold` and never
admits a put.

Seal/drain is intentionally before the `StreamFold` sidecar because it creates
fresh-tier generation state, not a base-table or graph-visible effect. Its
restart classifier is nevertheless explicit. A crash before the generation
manifest lands re-enters case 2 in §5 and uses the replay-watermark bridge
before resealing; a crash after the exact generation lands but before the
sidecar is case 3 and resumes that generation fold-only. Neither state may
admit a new put. Any active data beside an unmerged flushed generation, or any
second unmerged generation, fails closed rather than guessing which cut owns
the rows.

RC.1 writes the randomized generation dataset, Bloom filter, and PK sidecar
before it CASes the shard manifest. A crash in that interval can therefore
leave a generation directory that no manifest references. The active-stream
inventory classifies an unreferenced recognized `{hash}_gen_N/` subtree under
the bound shard—complete or partial—as derived orphan output: it is never
adopted as a generation, never descended into/read or folded, and never deleted
by B1. Parent-level shard discovery may observe only its prefix. It
does not make the durable WAL residue unrecoverable. Any loose object outside
that recognized generation-output subtree shape still fails closed. B2a keeps
these orphans inertly and unmetered for the root's lifetime. Only a future B2b
Lance-owned reclamation protocol may account for them and prove when they can
be removed.

The fold excludes generations already covered by the base table's exact
`merged_generations` and requires exactly one remaining B1 generation. It
constructs an exact post-drain `ShardSnapshot` directly from the authoritative
latest shard-manifest revision captured under the exclusive lease and supplies
it to public `LsmScanner::without_base_table`; it does not use the eventual
MemWAL-index snapshot or a live MemTable reference. The scanner streams only
that generation through the root's shared Session and the base's store
parameters when present, and resolves same-key rows
last-write-wins before staging one exact-ID upsert.

Base-dependent validation runs outside the table queue while admission remains
closed. Defaults were already fixed before acknowledgement and are not
re-applied. B1 folds the already-normalized physical rows it acknowledged;
physical vector columns pass through like other columns. It does not call an
external embedding provider or materialize unspecified fold-derived fields.
The deduplicated output is rechecked against the one sealed keyed-transaction
limit of 8,192 rows and 32 MiB of logical dense-slice Arrow bytes. Backing-buffer
capacity and process RSS are not the admission metric; RSS is retained only as
remeasurement evidence. An over-limit result is strict-blocked before any table
effect and leaves the acknowledged generation durable. The current transform
has no output-expansion source; a future derived-field transform must add
separate evidence for that bound rather than inheriting this claim. The fold
never splits one generation across transactions and never marks it merged
after a partial prefix. With or without RFC-024, the
`ReadSet` carries schema identity, the complete stream
binding/configuration/generation cut, the base table's exact
`CurrentHeadWitness`, every probed table, and the conservative branch authority
token `(native branch incarnation, optional graph_head)`.
Absence of `graph_head` on a fresh branch is part of that token. Any publisher
retry compares the captured token and returns to full fold revalidation on a
change; it never reparents a validation-sensitive fold around a concurrent
commit. RFC-024 may later narrow false contention with table heads but is not a
correctness dependency. The commit phase then:

1. stages accepted rows with Lance merge-insert and includes the exact
   `MergedGeneration` cut in that same base transaction;
2. derives and validates the exact winner token rows and durable fold-
   attribution commitment, then stages one exact keyed transaction against the
   manifest-selected `_stream_tokens.lance` version;
3. acquires every affected queue in canonical order and revalidates the
   complete `ReadSet` and winner set; any mismatch discards the effect-free plan
   and replans the whole fold;
4. writes one dedicated schema-v12 `StreamFold` payload before either commit;
   it carries stable table identity, exact binding and prior witnesses,
   shard/generation cut, both pre-minted transaction identities, planned token
   rows, complete lifecycle state-v2 outcome, fixed lineage, and attribution;
5. commits the exact base transaction and then the exact token transaction with
   zero transparent conflict retries;
6. durably confirms both achieved versions, transactions, merge progress,
   witnesses, and the complete fixed manifest outcome;
7. publishes the base pointer, token pointer, next lifecycle
   `CurrentHeadWitness`, fixed lineage, and fold attribution in one
   `__manifest` CAS; and
8. deletes the sidecar after successful publication.

That eight-step list is the implemented private B2 fold in the served v11
format. V11 preserves its recovery-v12 payload and the same two physical
participants and publication order byte-for-byte. Recovery-v13 is
`StreamProfileChange`-only and never means a fold. The later lifecycle strand
must add `StreamFoldV2`, carrying the expanded lifecycle and preserving its
current claim/tail commitments exactly. It does not append or advance a WAL
segment receipt; claims alone own that chain. That strand's separate drain-fold
variant additionally binds and revalidates the current claim's LWW projection.
Neither participant
may publish independently. Exact no-effect on both participants may retire and
replan; if the exact base effect landed but the token effect did not, recovery
may execute only the pre-minted token transaction from the durable plan. A
foreign, buried, token-only, or ambiguous partial outcome fails closed. A future
correction uses the same multi-participant envelope described in §4.4; it does
not turn a generation into multiple base-table keyed transactions.

Because `_stream_tokens.lance` is one graph-global physical participant, B2
adds one root-shared stream-token gate. The universal order for an ordinary or
other non-resident-producing manifest publisher is `graph-profile (shared or
exclusive, when required) -> sorted relevant stream admission -> schema ->
main branch -> stream token -> sorted graph tables -> selected same-key
queues`. A resident-producing served put first retains its bounded
preprocessing/inflight reservation and shared root MemWAL opportunity, then
joins that profile -> admission order. The driver instead holds the root
opportunity exclusive across the frozen round and takes profile/admission per
candidate. A writer that requires neither ordinary outer gate starts at schema;
a profile-bound writer with no relevant table admission skips only the
stream-admission step. No caller acquires a newly discovered root opportunity,
profile, stream-admission, or same-key authority after entering a later gate;
it releases and restarts from the root barrier. Every fold or
correction captures the token dataset's exact manifest-selected version,
transaction UUID in its `ReadSet`; it never persists or compares a
provider-local e_tag and never opens raw token HEAD as current authority. The
final gate rechecks that witness plus every winner's
stream incarnation/fold-base certificate before sidecar arm. A B2 recovery
sidecar that can move the token participant is graph-global relevant to
**every** operation that may publish `__manifest` or main authority: stream
operations, Mutation/Load, SchemaApply, BranchMerge, branch controls,
EnsureIndices, Optimize, Repair, Cleanup, recovery, and future writers all
resolve or refuse it before base capture even when its graph table is disjoint.
Quiesce and rebuild preflight use the same barrier. If final relisting discovers
a late global sidecar, stream lifecycle, required admission lease, or same-key
authority, the caller releases every held root-opportunity, graph-profile,
stream-admission, schema, branch, token, table, and same-key guard and restarts
from the root barrier; it
never recovers a
disjoint global sidecar while retaining one caller table's gate. This prevents
an unmanifested token HEAD from being buried by an ordinary graph commit.

The shared gate intentionally serializes token-table physical effects. Folds
still amortize many row acknowledgements, but B2 does not claim independent
per-table token commits. A token conflict proven effect-free across **both**
participants may finalize and fully reprepare from fresh manifest authority;
any base or token effect, or ambiguous classification, retains recovery
ownership and returns `RecoveryRequired`. Recovery converges only the exact
pre-minted pair under captured authority; it never adopts a token-table HEAD
merely because its rows look compatible.

The adapter is a distinct writer kind, not a Mutation payload with extra fields.
The sidecar is mandatory even though merge-insert is staged. After
`commit_staged`, Lance HEAD and `merged_generations` have moved while the graph
manifest has not. A failure in that window is the ordinary multi-table recovery
gap, not invisible staged state.

A commit-time key conflict follows RFC-023's partial-effect rule. If exact
classification proves that no fold participant advanced, the fold finalizes
the empty sidecar and may perform one bounded full replan from fresh authority.
If any participant advanced, or emptiness cannot be proved, it keeps the
sidecar and returns `RecoveryRequired`. No later fold is prepared until the
synchronous recovery barrier resolves that exact attempt; `merged_generations`
is never replanned around an unresolved partial fold.

MemWAL generation GC can start only after the exact fold and token outcome are
graph-visible, its sidecar is resolved, index catchup permits reclamation, and
no `FreshReadCut` or retained-version guard references the generation.
Data-HEAD merge progress alone is never permission to delete the only
fresh-tier copy. B1 deliberately performs no GC. B2a likewise deletes nothing
and retains the residue indefinitely without metering it; B2b consumes only the Lance-owned
inspect/plan/execute primitive and enforced admission watermark specified in
§4.5.2.

Concurrent folders reload `merged_generations`: a generation already committed
is skipped; otherwise the fold is replanned from current state. The explicit
fold stops new flush creation for its cut, waits for in-flight durability
waiters, and never aborts an acknowledged row. Default graph reads remain on
the old manifest pointer after the table commit and see the rows only after the
single manifest CAS.

The private B2 core embeds trusted contributor/write metadata in the stored row
and publishes the §4.2 winner summary plus current-token evidence. The graph
commit stores a durable commitment to the visible contributor/write winner set;
ordinary commits carry no fold summary. Provenance is never inferred from
MemTable positions or WAL cursor statistics. This row/fold design is active in
v9; v18 adds the separate stopped/offline exact `DataBlock` correction exit,
and current v19 adds terminal dead-letter evidence plus versioned attribution.
F7a activates public graph row exposure, F7b graph-redacted operational status,
and F7c selector-free graph-wide resume plus checked `SEALED`
EnsureIndices/Optimize through HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI. General
per-declaration lifecycle/abort/rebind, `AuthorityBlock` repair, direct SDK
checked-status/control parity, and the remaining F6 acceptance evidence remain
later gates; the checked physical status core remains internal.
The
registered Cedar vocabulary and embedded manifest-only status do not widen the
private row/fold seam.

## 7. Fold-time rejection is atomic

Phase B1 is strict only. A permanent RI, cardinality, uniqueness, or physical
row-validation failure returns a typed blocked outcome, publishes no table
pointer or lineage, and leaves the acknowledged generation durable and
unmerged. B1 admits no next generation while that one remains unmerged, so it
intentionally has no
correction lane and makes no claim that a later row can unblock it. B2's
bounded replacement/withdrawal protocol is specified in §4.4: current
recovery-v20 operates over the immutable cut, creates no second MemWAL
generation, preserves one base-table keyed transaction, advances the
manifest-selected token authority, and survives every two-participant crash
cell. It does not reinterpret recovery-v14's registered scaffold. No row is
silently dropped or credited to a dead letter. V19's separate recovery-v21
terminal path diverts data conflicts only after its object, token, recovery,
and retirement contracts are all present. DataBlock correction remains only
the stopped/offline cluster exit; public row/lifecycle activation remains
future.

The full `dead_letter` design remains Phase C; §4.7 P4 pulls one bounded,
terminal object-form subset into the experimental profile. The earlier
proposed identity
`(stable_table_id, incarnation_id, shard_id, generation, wal_position)` is not
implementable on RC.1's public contract: the durability watcher returns no WAL
position, its exposed batch positions are MemTable-local, the next WAL cursor is
only a statistic, and one WAL entry may carry multiple rows. Phase C must prove
a public, restart-stable reject-row identity and consume B2's already-durable
contributor attribution; it may use neither mutable aliases/paths nor inferred
WAL statistics.

The v19 experimental-profile subset uses the existing occurrence/token
identity for one current terminal object; it does not create a reject table.
A later Phase-C `_ingest_rejects` may become a versioned internal Lance
participant in the same fold/recovery/manifest pipeline. There remains no
reject-table retention promise or public dead-letter status surface.

## 8. Epoch-fenced quiescence barrier

Branch operations, schema changes, stream teardown, and Lance upgrades require a
real barrier, not an empty check.

Each enrolled table has a durable
`stream_state:<stable-table-id>:<incarnation-id>` row in its manifest branch with
`OPEN | DRAINING | SEALED`, configuration hash, an
`epoch_floor_by_shard: Map<shard_id, u64>`, the §3 physical binding, and the
current base-table `CurrentHeadWitness`. Epochs
are comparable only within the same enrollment and shard ID; a fresh shard in a
new binding may start at 1 and is fenced from its predecessor by enrollment and
shard identity, not by a larger number. The row is the logical lifecycle
authority and is updated by an RFC-022 CAS. MemWAL shard epochs are the shard
writer fence; the bounded profile pairs them with the process-local admission
lease and exclusive base-HEAD ownership. The general profile additionally
requires the cross-process substrate admission seal. Neither an empty-
generation observation nor an unscoped in-memory writer registry can
substitute for the profile's complete authority/fence pair.
Lifecycle-only transitions are audited manifest metadata transactions; they do
not create graph-content commits or move `graph_head`.

The bounded-profile drain sequence is:

1. acquire the root-scoped admission lease exclusively. This prevents a new
   final check/claim and waits until every append that passed its final check
   has resolved durability;
2. revalidate the exact `OPEN` binding, current-HEAD witness, and shard epoch,
   then publish `OPEN -> DRAINING` with the target epoch floor;
3. keep admission exclusively closed, claim/confirm the next shard epoch to
   fence a stale owner, and reject or backpressure every new append;
4. flush active MemTables and fold every
   generation to empty;
5. verify shard manifests and base `merged_generations` agree on emptiness and
   classify the exact ordered fence-only WAL inventory from §4.3;
6. publish `DRAINING -> SEALED` with the verified generation cut and exact
   achieved per-shard epoch map;
7. for an operation-scoped drain, perform the guarded operation; persistent
   public quiesce stops after step 6.

`OPEN -> DRAINING` and `DRAINING -> SEALED` are RFC-022 authority-first
metadata writes; each drain-mode fold is a separate graph write in the future
lifecycle recovery strand and exact drain mode specified by §4.3.
`DRAINING` fully encodes every target per-shard floor and two equal copies of
the current-HEAD witness; each graph-visible drain fold/correction advances both
copies. Restart therefore reconstructs the admission gate closed from the
latest row and resumes the drain. A
`SEALED -> OPEN` transition is different: an exact `stream_resume` sidecar
covers the higher-epoch claim while the gate remains exclusively closed and is
resolved before any ack path proceeds. The drain itself is not one giant
sidecar spanning multiple commits.

`DRAINING` is not allowed to become an operator trap. Public B2 must implement the
protocol-v2 descriptor and future lifecycle-strand recovery transition
specified in §4.3, including a
crash-safe abort transition for a quiesce that cannot finish: only when no
guarded schema/maintenance operation has begun, the exact current DRAINING row
and its equal witnesses still match, every owner has settled, and no unmerged
or strict-blocked cut remains may `stream resume --abort-drain` arm a resume
sidecar, claim a higher epoch under the closed gate, and CAS
`DRAINING -> OPEN`. A blocked/unmerged cut
must first fold, complete exact bounded `DataBlock` correction, or, once that
future owner exists, complete the reason-gated `AuthorityBlock` correction
from §4.4. Either correction remains
`DRAINING` and never opens as part of its CAS. B1 exposes neither transition
and cannot deadlock a public operator because it has no public caller.

For the general multi-process profile, step 3 must instead include the public
cross-process seal required by §3; it atomically refuses later claims and
fences a claimant that crossed another process's lifecycle check. The
process-local sequence is not evidence for that topology.

There are two dispositions after the drain reaches `SEALED`:

- **operation-scoped drain (Phase D)** — branch/schema maintenance automatically publishes
  `SEALED -> OPEN` only after the guarded operation succeeds, the stream
  contract remains compatible—including the bounded profile's exact
  no-named-graph-branch topology—and the §3 physical binding still names the
  exact table/ref and the guarded operation has published the table's new
  `CurrentHeadWitness` with its table pointer. A branch operation that makes
  that topology incompatible leaves the lifecycle `SEALED`; it cannot
  auto-resume. Under an exact resume sidecar,
  reopening the same binding
  advances each same-shard epoch above its recorded floor before the CAS; a
  pre-CAS failure keeps admission closed and recovery resumes or fails closed.
  If the operation rematerialized the table or changed/recreated its native
  ref, it must complete `stream_rebind` to a freshly proved `SEALED` binding
  and then run the separate resume transition instead of applying this
  transition directly;
- **persistent quiesce (Phase B2)** — the public `quiesce` command leaves the stream
  `SEALED`. It never auto-reopens. `stream resume` explicitly revalidates schema,
  PK, configuration, MemWAL format, physical binding, current-HEAD witness,
  every same-shard epoch, and the exact graph-branch topology under the same
  closed admission/schema/branch gates, then publishes `OPEN`. In the bounded
  profile any named graph branch keeps the stream `SEALED`. Stream teardown
  deletes intent only from `SEALED`.

The barrier never holds the table write queue while waiting for a fold that
needs that queue. The separate admission gate closes first; fold commit then
acquires the normal table queue. Crash recovery resumes from the durable state,
current-HEAD witness, and per-shard epoch map.

Future Phase-D schema apply must drain every affected enrolled type before
changing fields, constraints, PK, embeddings, or `@stream` and resumes only
when compatible. That writer is inactive in EXP, where schema change requires
checked export and rebuild into a fresh graph. RFC-028's current pure type
rename retains the same dataset, identity, path, and Lance version, so it does
not by itself rebind the physical enrollment. If a future schema feature
supports a rematerializing rename while preserving the logical pair, it cannot
preserve the old physical enrollment:

1. drain, fold, fence, and publish the old binding as `SEALED`;
2. let SchemaApply rematerialize and publish the target table while leaving the
   lifecycle row `SEALED`;
3. run the recovery-covered §3 `stream_rebind` against the exact target, with a
   fresh never-reused enrollment UUID, binding-scope ID, and shard UUID
   namespace. Its manifest CAS retains old binding/claim receipts and publishes
   the new `BindingReceipt`, scoped initial fence-only `ClaimReceipt`, current
   receipt ID, and exact empty proof while remaining `SEALED` and admitting no
   writer or put; and
4. run a separate recovery-covered `StreamResume`, claim an epoch strictly
   above the initial receipt **within that new scope**, and only then publish
   `OPEN`. New-scope epoch values are not compared with the old shard
   namespace.

The old shard namespace and artifacts remain retained until SchemaApply and
rebind sidecars are resolved and every fresh-read/recovery guard releases them.
A preserved physical enrollment never resets its generation or WAL-position
counters. A rebind never reuses an old shard UUID; pinned-Lance surface guards pin
that OmniGraph supplies a fresh UUID v4 to `mem_wal_writer` and that the new
namespace is disjoint from every prior binding for the logical table lifetime.

A Lance version upgrade requires persistent `stream quiesce --all`, but empty
generations alone are insufficient: the MemWAL system index, shard manifests,
epoch records, and generation directories may still use the old format. Before
the bump, the implementation must prove one of: (a) upstream guarantees and
cross-version tests cover every retained MemWAL artifact, (b) a public Lance
metadata migration converts them, or (c) OmniGraph tears down the enrolled
MemWAL metadata under recovery and re-enrolls after the bump. Without one of
those gates the upgrade refuses; `resume` never opens unverified old metadata.
This paragraph governs a Lance-only bump that preserves OmniGraph's current
internal format. An OmniGraph format rebuild follows §11 instead and never
opens retained source-graph MemWAL artifacts in the target graph.

## 9. Fresh-read cuts

Freshness is a first-class engine/IR enum:

```text
Committed
Fresh
```

At query planning, `Fresh` captures one `FreshReadCut` containing:

- the ordinary manifest snapshot;
- each selected table's exact lifecycle state, `StreamPhysicalBinding`, and
  `CurrentHeadWitness`;
- each selected shard-manifest version and writer epoch;
- included flushed-generation paths and maximum generation;
- the active same-process MemTable row-position watermark, when available;
- the base table's `merged_generations` and index-catchup state read from the
  exact table version selected by the manifest snapshot, never from live HEAD.

Capture uses a retrying handshake:

1. read each selected lifecycle row and require `OPEN`; capture its exact
   physical binding and current-HEAD witness, then read only that binding's
   shard manifests/epochs,
   acquire Lance generation retention guards for the flushed files in the
   tentative cut, and under one same-process writer snapshot capture/pin any
   active-MemTable watermark;
2. pin the graph manifest snapshot and require it to select the same lifecycle
   binding, current-HEAD witness, and physical base table/ref captured in step
   1; read
   `merged_generations` from each exact base-table version it selects. A
   `DRAINING`, `SEALED`, or different enrollment restarts the whole capture;
3. re-read the lifecycle rows, complete physical bindings, current-HEAD
   witnesses, shard manifest versions, and per-shard epochs. Any enrollment,
   witness, configuration, state, shard-set, manifest-version, or epoch change
   restarts the whole capture;
4. if a generation from step 1 disappeared, accept that only when the pinned
   base's `merged_generations` proves it is included; otherwise release guards,
   discard the whole graph snapshot, and retry from step 1;
5. exclude generations that appeared after step 1 and hold the generation and
   MemTable read guards captured in step 1 until query completion.

If Lance exposes no guard that prevents generation GC for the query lifetime,
cross-process `Fresh` does not ship. A missing generation is never interpreted
as “probably folded” against an older pinned base.

Execution never refreshes that cut mid-query. It excludes every flushed
generation `<= merged_generations[shard]`; otherwise old WAL data could outrank
or duplicate its newer base-table image.

Fresh reads have no cross-table atomicity. Same-process active MemTables provide
read-your-writes; other processes can promise only the latest flushed state
captured by their shard-manifest reads. The HTTP request and query docs state
those limits wherever the tier is exposed.

## 10. Observability and resource contracts

Phase B1 keeps row/fold observability internal. The later §4.7 slice exposes
only durable manifest authority through embedded `Omnigraph::stream_status`;
it does not expose physical worker state. F6b6 adds a separate checked
operational observation internally. F7b keeps the public embedded method
manifest-only and exposes a graph-redacted checked HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI
projection; direct-SDK checked status remains inactive. The private
implementation exposes test seams at its durability,
replay, fencing, resource, cut, fold, visibility, and recovery boundaries. The
2026-07-21 dense-scan repair and near-cap/RSS cell in §12.3 re-prove closure for
the widest admitted shape. That evidence is not a public latency SLO,
group-commit multiplier, current object-store result, physical-storage bound,
or claim that retained metadata work is history-flat.

B2's full status surface is the authority-plus-observation contract in §4.3.
It includes the exact lifecycle/binding, active epoch, drain operation,
pending generation/row/byte accounting when observable without cold replay,
merged progress, last fold outcome, strict
block, current operation summaries, lifecycle revision, all pending recovery, and
rebuild readiness. It does not expose public receipt-history pagination.
Cold-replay and flushed-LWW pending accounting plus exact oldest-uncovered-token
age remain explicitly unavailable; none is inferred from weaker timestamps or
cursor hints. `DISABLING` uses an explicit checked cluster-apply status owner.
All pending recovery sidecars are reported and block rebuild; a sidecar that
explains physical HEAD movement makes that projection unavailable rather than
manufacturing a mixed cut or a false movement error.
Optional retained-object counts/bytes are advisory current-listing diagnostics,
not admission or provider-billing truth.
Richer **user-table** index-catchup and reject detail may follow in Phase C;
the internal token-ledger covered/uncovered-fragment diagnostic required by
§4.3 is part of the activation profile. F6b7's failpoints-only bounded NO-GO
applies only to the uncompacted profile-cycle fixture and schedules no standalone
reconciler; evidence reopens beyond 260 uncovered fragments, after a Lance/index-
grammar change, or before considering graph-manifest-compacted or checked-
Optimize-coupled maintenance. Ordinary table optimize does not cover this
ledger. Lance's `wal_entry_position_last_seen`
and next-position statistics are explicitly labeled hints; neither is
presented as a durable per-row receipt or a way to resolve one `AckUnknown`
attempt.

Before public B2 activation, internal metrics must cover ack latency,
durability-wait batching, fenced writers, replayed entries, fold
rows/bytes/generations, fold retries, lag, reject counts, and sidecar recovery.
They also cover compare-and-chain conflicts/idempotent hits, token-table
effects, correction outcomes, retained object/byte diagnostics, and selected-
profile claim outcomes. B2b additionally covers its reservation ledger,
admission watermark, reclaim/checkpoint attempts, and receipts. Defaults for
every active row/memory/count/time bound must be documented, and configuration
changes are observable behavior. B2a has no storage-limit default to report.
The implemented private B2 default includes two 128-MiB root preprocessing
reservations (256 MiB total) acquired before blob materialization/canonical encoding; they are
separate from the 32-MiB queued-generation Arrow charge and does not weaken the
retain-all storage profile.

F6b4 closes the isolated production-size dead-letter encoder/verifier term.
The 2026-08-02 local macOS exact-cap run used 8,192 candidates, 10,364,432
source-value bytes, 62,301,270 canonical-payload input bytes, and 67,108,864
encoded bytes with exact 67,108,864-byte retained capacity. Encode and verify
took 286,280 and 2,254,424 microseconds. Paired peak RSS was 85,557,248 bytes
at baseline and 231,849,984 bytes at exact cap, a 146,292,736-byte lift.
`201,326,592` bytes (192 MiB) is a one-sided remeasurement tripwire for this
materialization shape, not admission, a quota, or a latency/RSS SLO. Before the
cap-aware writer fix, the same shape retained an observed 132,644,864-byte
encoded capacity. Exact object verification and stopped/offline payload export
retain the nested payload as raw canonical JSON, so legal small-scalar lists do
not create a second recursive allocation term. The JSON value/schema is
unchanged; the Rust DTO field type and serialized lexical member order may
differ from the former `serde_json::Value` representation.

The accepted acknowledgement-cost instrument scopes a warm, already-claimed
writer in steady state and includes both WAL append and synchronous in-memory
index/PK update performed before the watcher advances. It measures cold claim,
higher-epoch reopen, and replay separately because they may scale with the
retained WAL tail. It also separates the selected-generation **data scan** from
metadata work. B1 performs no generation GC, and RC.1 shard manifests retain
flushed-generation entries, so authoritative shard-manifest
fetch/decode/filter work must be swept against accumulated already-merged
generation metadata. The shared graph-manifest publisher retains its separately
documented uncompacted-history term. No metadata term is relabeled
history-flat here.

Phase-B2/Phase-C `stream status` resolves the exact lifecycle rows and MemWAL metadata through a
structured, bounded access path; it may reuse RFC-024's scalar-index machinery
but cannot claim history-flat cost while scanning manifest history.

## 11. Format activation and rebuild

Streaming is a graph-format capability, not a feature activated by the first
enrollment. Internal schema v19 is now the only served format. It preserves the
bounded B1 mechanics, complete v9 row/token contract, v10's frozen explicit-null
dead-letter compatibility placeholder, and v11 profile protocol v2; replaces lifecycle state-v2
inline histories with lifecycle-v3 fixed-size ledger/current authority; and
keeps manifest-selected `_stream_tokens.lance` authority. Recovery-v14 owns
the active hidden enrollment/claim/ordinary-fold/drain-fold/lifecycle-receipt
families. Recovery-v15 owns the private revision-fenced resume and guarded
drain-abort path, including the higher-epoch claim and terminal claim/management
receipts. Recovery-v16 owns only the capability-bound, main-only, same-binding
`SEALED` EnsureIndices overlay: the existing recovery-v8 CreateIndex plan plus
complete prior/next lifecycle rows, with no token effect or management receipt.
Recovery-v17 owns only the distinct capability-bound, main-only, same-binding
`SEALED` Optimize overlay. It records the complete confirmed output set and
each exact achieved table HEAD, with no token effect or management receipt.
Recovery-v18 owns only the distinct private physical-rebind overlay. It binds
the complete prior `SEALED` authority, one fresh enrollment plus empty shard,
immutable binding and fence-only claim receipts, and the exact next `SEALED`
proof. It admits no writer or put; recovery-v15 resume alone may open the fresh
scope.
Recovery-v19 owns only root-wide terminal authority retirement. It binds one
immutable, actor- and plan-bound receipt transaction and the sole
lineage-neutral `DISABLED → RETIRED` manifest publication that selects its exact
token witness. It moves no graph or branch head, creates no `GraphCommit` or
`RecoveryAudit`, and leaves the source query/status/export-only. Retired export
re-proves the receipt/profile/logical cut and emits the selected root receipt
plus the recomputable selected-member witness and ordered membership proof as
provenance before logical rows.
Recovery-v20 owns only stopped/offline exact `DataBlock` correction. It binds
the selected claim and blocked-generation winner set, one pre-minted base
transaction, and one combined token-successor/correction-receipt/management-
receipt transaction. Only their exact joint outcome may publish fold lineage,
clear that exact block, and leave the lane `DRAINING`; it does not reinterpret
the incomplete recovery-v14 correction scaffold or activate `AuthorityBlock`.
Recovery-v21 owns only the v19 terminal additions. `DeadLetterFold` binds one
canonical bounded object, exact base/token transactions, token-schema-v3
terminal evidence, versioned attribution, and the sole mixed/all-diverted
lifecycle/lineage result. `StreamAuthorityRetirementV2` binds exact
`PRESENT | WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED` counts and the selected token cut while
preserving retirement's lineage-neutral publication. Recovery-v19 and
recovery-v20 retain their exact historical meanings.
Recovery-v13 `StreamProfileChange` remains active with its exact old meaning.
Historical recovery-v10 enrollment, recovery-v12 lifecycle-v2 folds, and the
incomplete v14 sealed-maintenance/resume/correction/retirement/rebind scaffolds
are refused rather than synthesized.
Uncovered lifecycle, token, or MemWAL mismatches are refused. A physical
enrollment adds one table's MemWAL index, empty shard, and exact lifecycle row;
it does not change the graph stamp.

V7 activation followed Gate E0 and the bounded enrollment/recovery,
writer-exclusion, lifecycle, crash, and refusal/rebuild evidence. It is not
activation of row streaming. The ordinary SDK, CLI, server, schema parser, and
OpenAPI contain no enrollment or stream entry point; only the feature-gated
fault-injection suite can call the private adapter. The public exact-enrollment
and cross-process admission-seal surface remains required before expanding
beyond the bounded profile.

Phase B1 is a second, explicit format gate rather than an in-place
reinterpretation of v7. The private implementation uses internal schema v8,
stream-config v2, and recovery schema v11 for `StreamFold`. V8 is the first
format allowed to contain acknowledged
data-bearing MemWAL state. A v7/config-v1 private enrollment is accepted only
by the Phase-A binary and contains no publicly acknowledged rows; the B1 binary
refuses it and requires export/init/load into a different v8 root. The genuine
v7↔v8 old-binary/new-format and new-binary/old-format refusal/rebuild evidence
now passes (§12.3). V8 remains a private-core format with no public B2 caller.

B2 is the third strict strand: internal schema v9, stream-state protocol v2,
stream-config v3, and recovery-v12. V9 adds the reserved nullable stream-row
metadata to stream-capable physical schemas and initializes the
manifest-selected `_stream_tokens.lance` authority. It does **not** add a
`GraphHistoryBudget`, storage-meter singleton, aggregate receipt cap, or
physical-retention quota. Root initialization and first enrollment still use
the normal recovery-covered publication protocol for their actual authority
effects; unreferenced physical residue remains retained and inert.

V8 rows, lifecycle payloads, and private acknowledgements are never
reinterpreted or assigned contributor/token evidence with serde defaults. The
genuine v8↔v9 gate now builds the final schema-v8 binary, proves old-binary/new-
format and new-binary/old-format refusal, and performs strict
export/init/load rebuild. The rebuilt v9 graph preserves logical rows,
caller-supplied physical vector values, and exact-`id` PK metadata. Ordinary
export deliberately omits `__omnigraph_stream_v1$` and does not transfer token
authority. The pinned fixture includes a genuine v8 user property named
`__omnigraph_stream_v1` and proves its value round-trips unchanged. These
assignments are active private-core format state, not a public B2 contract.

Experimental P1 is the fourth strict strand: internal schema v10 adds the
required disabled-from-genesis `stream_profile` singleton and the now-frozen
explicit-null dead-letter compatibility placeholder. The genuine v9↔v10 gate
exists because a v9 decoder would otherwise skip the unknown enablement row
and write blind to a graph-wide freeze. The finalized dead-letter protocol
does not activate that incomplete placeholder in place.

The bounded F2 profile-authority tranche is the fifth strict strand: internal
schema v11, profile protocol v2, and recovery schema v13. Recovery-v12 remains
byte-for-byte the exact ordinary two-participant `StreamFold` envelope; v11
continues to use it. Recovery-v13 emits exactly one discriminator,
`StreamProfileChange`, which owns the exact token-ledger
`ProfileManagementReceipt` transaction and the fixed terminal profile CAS.
Unknown or later v13 variants fail closed.

V11 adds capability-bound cluster control/runtime ownership, a bounded
profile-receipt chain, durable `DISABLING` plan, fixed-principal fold
delegation/continuation authority, and the root-wide `RETIRED` profile shape
with mandatory retirement receipt ID and cut digest. `DISABLING` is explicit
and restart/resume-owned; the checked offline adapter can finish disable when
no lifecycle rows exist or every existing lane is already `SEALED`, but it
cannot drain a non-`SEALED` lane because no enrolled-lane claim/drain protocol
is active.
`RETIRED` decodes and fences writers, but its transition and retired
read/export boot are inactive. Historical `protocol_v10` enrollment remains
byte-for-byte unchanged.

The hidden F2 lifecycle tranche is the sixth strict strand: internal schema
v12, lifecycle protocol v3, and recovery schema v14. It activates
`StreamEnrollmentV2`, claim, ordinary `StreamFoldV2`, drain-fold, and
`StreamLifecycleReceipt`; resume/abort, data/authority correction,
`StreamAuthorityRetirement`, token-ledger-index maintenance, sealed
maintenance, and rebind remain registered but fail closed. F3 must audit the
frozen scaffolds and use v14 only when an exact payload suffices; otherwise it
takes a new strand. F3e later activated the retirement/export exit before F3f
made correction-created `WITHDRAWN` reachable; F5 later extends the exit for
`DEAD_LETTERED`. No historical
stamp or recovery version changes meaning. The genuine v11↔v12 gate proves
both-direction refusal and export/init/load rebuild from a clean, disabled,
unenrolled final-v11 source graph.
V10 has no production admission surface; the fixture proves the supported
clean, disabled, unenrolled source rebuild without transferring private stream
authority. It does **not** prove that v10's ordinary exporter detects an
artificial test-only pending-WAL image: v10 has no stream-aware export
preflight. Such a root is outside the supported v10 rebuild contract and must
be quarantined rather than treated as transferred. The later stream-aware
export contract owns typed refusal once acknowledged stream state is reachable
through a production surface.

The private F3a resume tranche is the seventh strict strand: internal schema
v13 and recovery-v15. Recovery-v15 owns the complete revision-fenced
`SEALED → OPEN` resume or guarded `DRAINING → OPEN` abort, including the
higher-epoch physical claim and terminal ClaimReceipt plus ManagementReceipt.
The frozen recovery-v14 resume scaffold retains its original three-field
meaning and remains refused. The genuine v12↔v13 gate proves both-direction
refusal and export/init/load rebuild.

The narrow F3b EnsureIndices tranche is the eighth strict strand: internal
schema v14 and recovery-v16. V16 reuses recovery-v8's exact
CreateIndex transaction grammar and adds only the captured enabled profile,
selected token-authority witness, and sorted complete prior/next `SEALED`
lifecycle rows. It publishes table pointers and proof refreshes together,
advances no token pointer or receipt chain, and cannot represent Optimize or
rebind. The frozen recovery-v14 `StreamSealedMaintenance` scaffold is not
reinterpreted. The genuine v13↔v14 gate proves both-direction refusal and
export/init/load rebuild.

The narrow F3c Optimize tranche is the ninth strict strand: internal
schema v15 and recovery-v17. V17 owns the non-caller-minted Optimize result by
recording the complete confirmed output set and exact achieved table HEADs;
only those outcomes can refresh productive pointers and `SEALED` lifecycle
proof in the manifest CAS. It cannot represent EnsureIndices or rebind and does
not reinterpret the frozen recovery-v14 scaffold. The genuine v14↔v15 gate
proves both-direction refusal and export/init/load rebuild.

The narrow F3d physical-rebind tranche is the tenth strict strand: internal
schema v16 and recovery-v18. V18 owns the complete prior exact
`SEALED` authority, fresh enrollment and empty shard effects, immutable binding
and fence-only claim receipts, and exact next `SEALED` proof. It keeps the lane
closed and requires a separate recovery-v15 resume to open the new scope. It
does not reinterpret recovery-v14's three-field rebind scaffold. The genuine
v15↔v16 gate proves both-direction refusal and export/init/load rebuild.

The F3e terminal-exit tranche is the eleventh strict strand: internal
schema v17 and recovery-v19. A checked stopped/offline, state-lock-held plan
requires exact `DISABLED`, every enrolled lane `SEALED`, settled recovery,
base/token parity, and at least one current `WITHDRAWN` token. Actor-bound
confirmation appends the immutable retirement receipt and selects it with
`RETIRED` in one lineage-neutral manifest CAS. The source then permits only
read/query/status/export, and export includes the selected root receipt plus a
recomputable selected-member witness and the ordered proof needed to recover
the receipt-bound cut. The frozen recovery-v14
retirement scaffold is not reinterpreted.
The genuine v16↔v17 gate proves both-direction refusal and clean
export/init/load rebuild.

The F3f DataBlock-correction tranche is the twelfth strict strand: internal
schema v18 and recovery-v20. A state-lock-held, stopped/offline show
reconstructs one exact receipt-bound generation and re-proves the canonical
validator view; correct accepts a bounded ordered `REPLACE | WITHDRAW` plan,
fully validates the resulting winner overlay before effect, and remains
`DRAINING`. Recovery owns one pre-minted base transaction plus one combined
token-successor/correction-receipt/management-receipt transaction and permits
only their exact joint publication. The genuine v17↔v18 gate proves
both-direction refusal and clean export/init/load rebuild. At that tranche,
`AuthorityBlock` repair, F5 `DEAD_LETTERED` authority, public lifecycle
controls, and every served/remote row surface remained inactive.

Because v10/P1 is already a served format, F2 co-lands the corresponding
`docs/user/operations/upgrade.md` update and release note; those instructions
are not deferred to public-ingest F7. They require stopping writer processes,
using the old v10 binary to disable the profile and verify no lifecycle,
recovery, or private acknowledged-WAL authority remains, exporting each wanted
branch, then initializing/loading a different v11 root and validating it
before cutover. A v10 source containing artificial/private pending stream
authority is outside the supported rebuild contract and must be quarantined;
ordinary export must not be represented as transferring it. The guidance states
the old/new binary refusal boundary, loss of unexported history, and that no
in-place upgrade or rollback is supported.
F2 also co-lands the mutation, direct-CLI, error, and cluster-configuration
documentation for its immediately observable ownership change: while the
profile is `ENABLED`, Mutation/Load/delete require the exact checked served
runtime; while it is `DISABLING`, those writers are closed. BranchMerge is
closed under both modes even through the served runtime, and an embedded SDK
or direct `--store` caller refuses even before public firehose ingress exists.
Those docs
also state that unmanaging after terminal disable does not de-enroll a table or
restore the direct lane. The F2 release note repeats—not merely links—the
warning that `streaming: true` is non-additive in that release: it disables
embedded/direct Mutation/Load/delete while no public firehose ingress exists,
and it gives the explicit-disable escape for an unenrolled graph, documents
that already-`SEALED` lanes permit the profile transition without restoring
the direct lane, and retains the rebuild requirement after enrollment. F7
later adds the firehose endpoints and remote
surface; it does not postpone documentation of F2 behavior.

F5 is the v19 strict strand after lifecycle activation, with recovery-v21. It
adds `DEAD_LETTERED` token authority, mixed/all-diverted fold outcomes, one
bounded deterministic dead-letter-object reference, and
format-specific authority-retirement evidence. Recovery owns the conditional
object publication and the sole token/base/manifest decision. Exact retry is
valid only while the terminal token remains current. Repair is a fresh
ordinary correction that publishes a `PRESENT` successor; the format has no
`Replay` origin, replay receipt, checkpoint chain, or maintained dead-letter
inventory. Retirement binds the exact pre-retirement current-token cut and
streams that selected token version in bounded batches without materializing a
token-row vector. It does not reinterpret v11/v13. `DEAD_LETTERED` activation
follows the green one-object, all-diverted, predecessor-refusal, and generic-
writer-freeze cells.

Nine later strict strands are already implemented: v10→v11 profile authority
with recovery-v13, v11→v12 hidden lifecycle authority with recovery-v14,
v12→v13 resume with recovery-v15, v13→v14 SEALED EnsureIndices with
recovery-v16, v14→v15 SEALED Optimize with recovery-v17, v15→v16 physical
rebind with recovery-v18, v16→v17 terminal authority retirement with
recovery-v19, v17→v18 exact DataBlock correction with recovery-v20, and
v18→v19 terminal dead-letter authority with recovery-v21.
Each later settled format family receives a new graph/recovery
strand unless a pre-implementation audit proves the exact vocabulary was
already registered with fail-closed decoding. We do not promise a fixed strand
count while the payload grammar is unsettled, and we do not pre-register a
guessed shape merely to avoid a rebuild. Before the first stable release that
exposes streaming, the chosen families are frozen and the release notes state
the actual rebuild count.

Old binaries refuse a stream-capable graph before reading or writing any table.
A stream-capable binary refuses an older graph before running recovery. On a
compatible stamp it resolves or refuses every stream recovery kind relevant to
that format and binding before validation—B1 enrollment/fold, B2
resume/abort-drain, experimental P7 rebind, and later automatic Phase-D rebind
included—then refuses an **uncovered**
partial-format state in which the stamp, accepted schema identity, enrolled
MemWAL metadata, and lifecycle authorities disagree. A covered stream crash is
recoverable intent, not format corruption. The engine never repairs an
uncovered mismatch by inferring ownership from a table name, path, or
compatible-looking system index.

The same rule will cover schema rematerialization once stream-aware SchemaApply
is implemented. A preserved `(stable_table_id, incarnation_id)` with a new physical
table is a `SEALED` stream awaiting the exact §3 rebind, not an `OPEN` stream
and not permission to attach old shards. Recovery classifies the old and new
bindings independently and retains the old artifacts until their sidecars and
read guards permit reclamation.

There is no in-place activation or rollback to an old format. V6→v7, v7→v8,
v8→v9, v9→v10, v10→v11, v11→v12, v12→v13, v13→v14, v14→v15, v15→v16,
v16→v17, and v17→v18 move only through the strict export/init/load strand.
Neither v6 nor v7 can contain publicly acknowledged
MemWAL rows, so the stream-specific quiesce steps below are vacuous for those
transitions; they become load-bearing for any later rebuild from a format that
exposes durable admission:

1. persistently quiesce every enrolled stream, fold every acknowledged row
   into the manifest-visible base tables, and drive the profile to ordinary
   `DISABLED`;
2. verify `SEALED`, empty-generation, merged-generation, sidecar, and uncovered
   drift invariants on the source graph and exact PRESENT/base parity; then
   either prove zero current terminal `DEAD_LETTERED | WITHDRAWN` authority or
   use that same-format binary to select its version-appropriate exact
   irreversible `StreamAuthorityRetirement` receipt bound to the immutable
   pre-retirement token witness, bounded disposition counts, and live
   branch-head cut;
3. use the old-format binary to export each selected branch's current logical
   state and, for `RETIRED`, its exact opaque retirement receipt;
4. use the new binary to initialize a different graph root and load the export
   through RFC-022;
5. validate the rebuilt graph before cutting clients over.

Ordinary export contains only manifest-visible graph state. WAL-only rows,
MemWAL indexes, shard manifests, epochs, lifecycle rows, reject history,
fresh-read guards, and fold checkpoints are not transferred. Therefore step 1
is mandatory: an acknowledged but unfolded row would otherwise be lost. The
same is true of terminal stream authority: ordinary export returns
`StreamExportBlocked` while any current token is `DEAD_LETTERED | WITHDRAWN`;
a dead-letter payload export is an inspection artifact, not an import contract.
Only the same-format irreversible retirement alternative above may authorize
row-only export with terminal authority still recorded, because its sole
manifest CAS has already made the entire source permanently read/export-only
at the exact cut. The receipt is provenance and does not become target
sequencing authority.
The new graph starts with no physical stream enrollment. Phase B2 must wire
declared first use through §3 before production can enroll after cutover. The
rebuild also loses branches not separately exported, commit DAG, snapshots,
tombstones, recovery history, and time travel, as specified by RFC-028's
common format strand.

The retained source graph and its MemWAL artifacts remain owned by the old
binary and are never opened by the new target as migration input. A failed
target init/load cannot mutate the source. Independently released later format
capabilities require another rebuild; co-release with RFC-023, RFC-024, RFC-025,
or RFC-028 is allowed only after every participating RFC is independently
accepted and their combined init, refusal, recovery, and rebuild matrix passes.

Enrollment, fold, and recovery retain RFC-022's single-live-writer-process
support boundary, strengthened for the bounded profile by exclusive base-HEAD
ownership while `OPEN`. MemWAL's shard epoch permits a crash successor after
external exclusivity; it does not turn OmniGraph sidecar recovery into
distributed fencing or authorize overlapping replica failover.

## 12. Acceptance gates

### 12.1 Gate E0 — bounded enrollment decision (green)

Gate E0 is deliberately isolated from the production manifest schema and write
path. Its checked-in evidence suite must prove all of the following on the
pinned public RC.1 surface before the bounded profile can proceed:

- From exact baseline HEAD `N` with no MemWAL index, initializer success yields
  exactly `N + 1`, whose transaction reads `N` and contains only one singleton
  `__lance_mem_wal` `CreateIndex` with the requested unsharded configuration,
  namespaced enrollment ID, and configuration-version marker. The marker
  is classified independently of the index UUID and survives ordinary commits
  and merged-generation metadata updates.
- Discarding the initializer result and reopening produces the same exact
  allowed-successor classification; an index-only crash is therefore
  distinguishable from no effect without relying on the mutable Dataset
  handle.
- Passing a pre-minted UUID through the public shard-writer path produces only
  that shard with the expected unsharded spec, observable claimed epoch, empty
  generations, and no data-bearing WAL. Any deterministic data-less fence
  artifact is enumerated explicitly rather than treated as “empty enough.”
- The classifier truth table accepts only: exact no effect (finalize), the
  exact index-only successor (roll forward), and that successor plus the exact
  empty pre-minted shard (roll forward). Wrong configuration, an intervening
  HEAD, another index transaction, a foreign shard, unexpected WAL/generation
  data, a buried effect, or unreadable/ambiguous evidence yields
  `RecoveryRequired`; the harness never deletes or reclaims an artifact.
- `CurrentHeadWitness` is stable across an unchanged reopen, changes after an
  ordinary commit, and distinguishes same-path/same-version recreation on
  local FS and S3/RustFS. Starting from a freshly verified exact-`N` handle,
  the immediate `N + 1` and buried-`N + 2` successor probes are bounded in
  history depth; flatness is measured, not inferred from the tuple shape.

**Gate E0 result (2026-07-18): green for the bounded profile.** The final local
run reports 14 substantive tests plus one explicit S3 skip when no bucket is
configured. It covers the exact no-effect/index-only/index-plus-empty-shard
progression, high-level pre-minted `mem_wal_writer`, lost-result
reclassification, durable marker survival, buried-effect refusal, strict
inventory/error handling, and the complete local fail-closed matrix.

The earlier `checkout_latest`/`IOTracker` result was discarded because local
filesystem `read_dir` bypassed that tracker. The accepted classifier never
resolves latest. It opens exact `N`, uses the doc-hidden public
`Dataset::has_successor_version` for `N + 1`, and repeats it on exact `N + 1` to
reject a buried `N + 2`. Its `AttemptTracker` records every attempt before
forwarding, including failed and `NotFound` HEADs. At baseline versions 8 and
80 the complete shape is identical: four successful manifest HEADs, one
`NotFound` manifest HEAD, one successful manifest GET, and zero `list` or
`list_with_delimiter` calls. A Unix execute-only `_versions` tripwire proves
the exact probe succeeds while latest enumeration fails; an unreadable exact
HEAD returns an error rather than false/no-effect.

The configured RustFS exact cell passes non-vacuously. It covers no effect,
opaque initializer lost result, exact index-only state, the pre-minted empty
shard, unchanged reopen, and fail-closed foreign-shard, malformed-plus-loose-
root, durable-WAL, persisted-cursor, and corrupt-manifest states. It observes
the same six-attempt, zero-list exact-probe shape. Separate surface guards pin
`has_successor_version`, flush/drain, merged-generation state, and object-store
same-coordinate ABA; CI rejects a skipped Gate E0 or ABA cell.

This green decision authorizes only Phase A's production foundation: exact
roll-forward enrollment recovery, central lifecycle effect exclusion (with the
narrow `SEALED` native-branch exception), lifecycle/current-witness state, and
admission-lease races. It does not change
the schema parser, expose an API, or acknowledge a WAL row.
The general upstream receipt/seal path remains the preferred simplification and
the gate for broader topology.

### 12.2 Phase A — bounded production foundation (green)

Phase A is implemented at the deliberately narrow boundary established by E0:

- Internal schema v7 adds one identity-keyed
  `stream_state:<stable_table_id>:<incarnation_id>` authority row carrying the
  never-reused enrollment/shard binding, exact mutable current-HEAD witness,
  `OPEN | DRAINING | SEALED`, and per-shard epoch floor. Publication uses an
  expected-value CAS; identity is never inferred from alias or path.
- A dedicated schema-v10 `StreamEnrollment` sidecar owns the exact baseline,
  fixed lineage, intended config/binding, and only allowed `N -> N + 1`
  initializer effect. Recovery accepts exact no effect, exact index-only, or
  exact index-plus-empty-shard. Index-only provisions the pre-minted shard;
  the complete state publishes the table pointer plus `OPEN` row. Once an
  effect exists the adapter is roll-forward-only: it never restores the table
  or deletes/reclaims MemWAL artifacts.
- Enrollment is crate-private (with one feature-gated failpoint seam), supports
  canonical main and exactly one empty unsharded epoch-1 shard, and refuses
  while any named graph branch exists. There is no production SDK, CLI, HTTP,
  OpenAPI, or schema-language call site.
- One root-scoped process-local admission lease is acquired outside the
  schema → branch → sorted-table gates. Existing graph writers, SchemaApply,
  BranchMerge, EnsureIndices, Optimize, Repair, Cleanup, recovery, and native
  branch controls join the same admission/exclusion discipline and re-check
  lifecycle authority under their final gates. Phase A fences every
  base-table, schema, maintenance, repair-adoption, and recovery effect for any
  lifecycle row, including `SEALED`, because it has no witness-update/rebind
  adapter yet. Native branch create/delete is the narrow exception: it may
  proceed at `SEALED` because it does not advance the table HEAD, while
  `OPEN`/`DRAINING` still refuses it.
- The initial topology closes the cross-branch authority hole explicitly:
  enrollment requires a main-only graph, branch create/delete refuses an
  `OPEN` or `DRAINING` lifecycle, and open-time consistency refuses that
  lifecycle if a named branch exists. This is a bounded support rule, not
  branch-aware streaming.
- Read-write open resolves exact enrollment intents before serving. Read-only
  open refuses a pending enrollment intent. Compatible opens then validate
  every lifecycle against the manifest-selected identity/path/witness and
  exact physical empty-shard state, and reject an uncovered MemWAL index or
  other partial-format mismatch.
- V7 remains a strict strand: v7 refuses genuine v6 and v6 refuses v7; upgrade
  is export/init/load into a different root. Crash tests cover no-effect,
  index-only, and index-plus-empty-shard recovery, plus named-branch and
  uncovered-format refusals. Lower-level tests pin lifecycle CAS, typed writer
  exclusion, admission ordering, and the exact E0 classifier.

This is a production-format and recovery foundation, not a usable stream.
Phase A never calls the WAL row `put` path, never emits a durability
acknowledgement, never folds a generation, and never exposes drain/resume or
fresh reads. Although v7 can encode `DRAINING` and `SEALED`, their operational
transitions are not implemented: B2 owns minimum explicit quiesce/resume for a
public escape, while Phase D owns automatic operation drain and rebind.

### 12.3 Phase B1 — private strict core implementation ledger

The Phase-B1 implementation landed on 2026-07-19. It is reachable only through
one `#[doc(hidden)]`, feature-gated engine seam; there is no schema syntax,
ordinary SDK method, HTTP/CLI/OpenAPI route, or production first-use caller.
This section distinguishes implemented behavior from checked evidence and
the then-accepted private boundary. All then-declared Phase-B1 gates passed on
2026-07-19. Gate R0 then exposed one legal near-cap closure failure; the
2026-07-21 dense-scan repair and remeasurement close that failure and requalify
the one-generation B1 boundary. “Green” never meant public activation, and the
RFC remains draft.

**Implemented private core**

- Internal schema v8, stream-config v2, and the dedicated schema-v11
  `StreamFold` envelope activate the private data-bearing format. Configuration
  identity, exact table/enrollment/shard binding, epoch, immutable generation
  cut, exact transaction, `MergedGeneration`, lifecycle witness, and fixed
  lineage are validated rather than inferred from aliases or compatible-looking
  state.
- The public Lance surfaces consumed by B1 are compile-guarded: `put_no_wait`
  and its watcher, forced seal/drain and quiesced `abort`, public in-memory
  MemTable/BatchStore inspection, the replay-watermark bridge,
  caller-supplied `ShardSnapshot`, `LsmScanner::without_base_table`, shared
  Session/store-parameter propagation, staged merge, and merged-generation
  publication. The runtime substrate guard reproduces RC.1's cross-generation
  false-ack shape; B1 avoids it with one explicit no-roll generation and writer
  retirement before any successor-generation put.
- Watcher success proves durability but no longer completes a clean
  acknowledgement by itself. The background-owned admission path next calls
  `check_fenced()` on the same `ShardWriter`; only `Ok(())` may produce
  `DurableBatchAck`. Epoch loss, an epoch-read error, owner-task failure, or a
  deadline before that check settles is post-invocation `AckUnknown` and
  retires the worker. This is an OmniGraph B1 containment, not a Lance
  reclamation primitive or a distributed writer fence.
- One root-scoped registry is shared across graph handles and owns the full
  binding's serialized worker. The common admission key remains table identity
  plus resolved physical ref, not enrollment or shard identity. Cold claim,
  warm final check, put/watcher ownership, seal/drain, retirement, and recovery
  use that one shared/exclusive domain. Lance futures continue in owned tasks
  when a request deadline or cancellation drops only its waiter.
- Admission accepts one non-empty, exact-schema physical `RecordBatch` and one
  contiguous ordinal range. Raw row/byte bounds reject obviously over-cap input
  before recovery I/O and before the bounded tombstone allocation; raw-fit input
  then receives exact post-tombstone validation before that recovery I/O. After
  any recovery/authority prelude, the exact charge is recomputed and reserved
  against the root aggregate. Every resident-producing served put uses bounded
  preprocessing/inflight → root MemWAL opportunity shared → graph-profile
  shared → table admission → same-key input queue → worker-mode inspection
  before detached ownership, cold claim, or `put_no_wait`; that queued charge
  transfers into the resident generation without double-counting;
  crossing the generation cap is typed, row-effect-free `FoldRequired`.
  Anything after invocation is `AckUnknown`, never an effect-free retry.
- Reopen validates config, binding, lifecycle witness, epoch, authoritative WAL
  cursor, exact generation topology, and merge progress. Empty state may admit;
  non-empty replay or one flushed-unmerged generation is fold-only. The public
  replay-watermark bridge marks only the proven durable replay prefix before
  reseal, preventing repeated pre-generation-manifest retries from multiplying
  its WAL/index entries. Exact replay accounting and the fold-only marker are
  installed before the cold opener releases its queue position. Already-charged
  callers then drain; their transient overlap with recovered replay is recorded
  honestly even when it exceeds the nominal root cap, while new charges are
  refused immediately.
- One explicit private fold owns exclusive admission, seals/drains and retires
  one writer, proves empty frozen refs plus the authoritative generation/cursor,
  scans one exact fresh-only generation, applies last-write-wins by `id`, runs
  base-dependent validation, and stages one exact-ID upsert with
  `MergedGeneration` in the same Lance transaction. It folds already-normalized
  physical rows—including physical vector columns—and performs no external
  embedding call or unspecified fold-derived-field materialization. Scanner
  output is row/byte checked and copied into dense owned Arrow arrays before it
  is retained, so sparse variable-width slices cannot charge or pin their full
  backing buffers through the fold. One
  manifest CAS publishes the achieved table pointer, next lifecycle witness,
  and fixed lineage; default reads remain old until that CAS.
- Resource reservations cover queued input, the resident generation, and the
  sealed cut through fold publication. The evidence-qualified private limit is
  one resident writer and a nominal 32-MiB aggregate logical dense-slice Arrow
  admission budget per graph root; cold replay discovered after callers were charged is the narrow
  transient-overlap exception above. A cold fold reserves the full budget plus
  resident/pending slots before its owned opener and carries the original seal
  deadline through that open. Any higher resident concurrency or larger steady
  budget is a B2 requalification, not an implied default. A failed or stalled
  abort retains the original registry retirement and admission authority. B1
  performs no generation GC and admits no correction generation beside
  strict-blocked input. The isolated fold RSS measurement and its 384-MiB
  remeasurement tripwire are evidence for this one exclusive fold, not a
  runtime allocator limit or storage quota.

**Checked evidence**

- In-source worker tests pin exact config-v2 reconstruction/no-roll settings,
  logical dense-slice Arrow accounting, ordinal validation, root-registry sharing,
  pre-effect resource refusals, fold-reservation lifetime, and the rule that a
  deadline continuation owns its authority until one settled handoff. A source
  guard rejects direct timeout cancellation around Lance futures.
- Feature-gated graph tests pin empty/wrong-schema rejection, watcher-backed
  durability plus the post-durability epoch check before clean acknowledgement,
  post-watcher epoch loss as `AckUnknown` with worker retirement, manifest
  invisibility before fold, same-key LWW, the exact row cap, pre-invocation
  effect-free reuse, other post-invocation `AckUnknown`, request cancellation,
  graph-content invisibility before fold (claim receipts may move only
  operational manifest authority), root-shared handles,
  cold-claim-versus-exclusive-fold ordering,
  stalled-abort retirement, replay/reseal idempotence,
  flushed-generation fold-only routing, strict validation blocking,
  post-force-seal typed `RecoveryRequired`, post-table-effect recovery, and the
  unsafe `X(unknown) -> Y(durable) -> retry X` overwrite.
- Recovery-unit tests pin schema-v11 serialization/refusal, exact cut and
  contiguous merge-progress shape, exact `N`/`N+1` effect classification, and
  atomic achieved-effect confirmation. Graph integration proves a table effect
  remains manifest-invisible and read-write reopen rolls the exact confirmed
  fold forward. A separate final-gate race injects an effected Mutation sidecar
  for another `main` table after the fold's initial recovery barrier and
  post-drain cut; the fold refuses publication until that intent is recovered.
- Forbidden-API coverage keeps the implementation private and rejects schema,
  SDK, server, CLI, OpenAPI, or generic raw-Lance row side doors.
- The genuine cached-binary v7 ↔ v8/config-v2 matrix passes in both directions:
  the then-current v8 binary refuses the final v7 image before table use, v7 refuses a genuine
  v8 root, and v7 export → v8 init/load → v8 re-export preserves the logical
  rows and exact-`id` PK contract. The v7 fixture is unenrolled because that
  binary exposes no production enrollment route; this proves the real format
  fence and no in-place adoption, not recovery of retained physical config-v1
  state.
- The expanded serialized graph-level B1 suite passes, including the
  post-watcher epoch-loss cell. In addition to admission/replay/race coverage,
  it crosses `StreamFold` sidecar arm, exact table effect, achieved-effect
  confirmation, confirmed pre-publish refusal, manifest publication/lost
  response, post-publish audit retry, and sidecar cleanup. Reopen or the next
  barrier converges each retained exact outcome; audit is exactly once.
- The accepted local cost instrument keeps every measured term separate.
  Post-containment warm already-claimed acknowledgement at compacted graph-
  history depths 8 and 80 remains flat: both endpoints record 9 table reads /
  219 bytes, 2 writes / 1,096 bytes, 2 tracked WAL writes, 9 graph-manifest
  reads, and 21 adapter operations. The 2026-07-19 pre-check baseline was 6
  reads / 146 bytes, so the explicit epoch probe adds 3 reads / 73 bytes while
  remaining history-flat. The remaining term-separated evidence is unchanged:
  cold replay at retained-WAL depths
  1/8/32 records 5/19/67 WAL reads and 3,303/19,218/73,878 aggregate tracked
  bytes. A selected 1/4,096-row generation contains 601/41,885 physical
  generation-data bytes; its observed range-read counters are 4/2 reads and
  3,853/2,651 bytes. Retained merged-generation counts 1/4/8 show largest
  retained shard-manifest payloads of 52/112/192 bytes. The uncompacted
  graph-manifest fold term remains explicitly
  non-flat: depths 8→80 grow from 46 reads / 111,918 bytes to 334 reads /
  1,112,718 bytes.
- The configured RustFS warm-ack figures remain the 2026-07-19
  **pre-containment** baseline because no RustFS environment was configured for
  the post-check run. At compacted depths 8 and 80 both endpoints recorded 9
  table reads / 146 bytes, 1 write / 1,096 bytes, 1 WAL write, 12 graph-
  manifest reads, and 21 adapter operations; observed elapsed time was
  38.426/49.253 ms. Rerun this cell before a current object-store ack-cost
  claim. These are evidence-run observations, not a latency SLO or group-
  commit multiplier.
- The current widest one-batch dense generation uses 3,742 payload bytes per
  row and reserves 33,550,336 B2-attributed logical Arrow bytes, 4,096 below
  the 32-MiB cap. The exact 3,743-byte-per-row neighbor charges 33,558,528,
  4,096 above the cap, and is rejected effect-free through the real adapter.
  The legal RC trigger estimate is 33,583,144 bytes; the conservative worst
  8,192-one-row-batch trigger upper bound is 33,914,880 bytes. Both remain
  below the explicit 1-GiB no-roll threshold and 8,192 remains below the 8,193
  row/batch threshold. Isolated one-batch whole-process peak RSS moves from
  77,725,696 to 264,683,520 bytes (+186,957,824), explicitly including Arrow,
  PK-index, runtime, and allocator overhead. That result qualifies one resident
  writer with one 32-MiB aggregate attributed Arrow reservation. Queued batches
  share that reservation rather than accumulating outside it. The repaired
  high-entropy widest fold publishes all 8,192 rows and measures an isolated
  whole-process peak-RSS delta of 286,441,472 bytes (about 273 MiB / 286 MB)
  over the small-fold baseline. CI uses 384 MiB only as a remeasurement
  tripwire for that one exclusive fold. It is not enforced allocator admission,
  and concurrent residents must be measured before either concurrency or the
  logical generation limit changes.

**Evidence qualification**

- Adapter failpoints bracket invocation, watcher completion, force-seal,
  post-drain proof, pre-sidecar cut ownership, and post-table commit. The
  stalled-abort rendezvous proves a second put cannot reopen the slot and an
  exclusive fold cannot pass the retained original retirement. These tests
  exercise the externally observable adapter boundary; they do **not** inject
  Lance's internal fast-flush channel loss or an internal handler failure.
  Pinned RC.1 source plus the independent frozen-ref/shard-manifest proof is the
  current protection. A direct upstream-internal failure seam remains
  unavailable and must not be described as injected evidence.
- The common-lock tests park a cold claimant immediately before put and park a
  fold before seal, proving shared/exclusive contention with ordinary writers
  and folds. The final-gate race above covers a genuine different-table sidecar
  appearing between the fold's initial barrier and final gates. Production also
  re-lists relevant sidecars and revalidates fresh authority before claim and
  before put. The suite has not forged a relevant stream sidecar in that exact
  pre-claim/pre-put window; direct injection there remains a test-seam
  limitation, not a claimed adversarial cell.
- The post-durability `check_fenced()` closes only the stale-epoch
  **clean-ack** outcome at the private OmniGraph B1 boundary. It does not
  retract a WAL effect, make raw sentinel deletion safe, fence raw Lance
  callers, or provide a reclamation receipt, cross-process seal, or failover
  protocol. The Lance-owned post-success fence and retention patch therefore
  remain B2b managed-reclamation and broader-topology gates. They did not block
  the completed private no-delete, single-live-writer-process B2a gate, which
  retains the wrapper's post-watcher fence check. The later private v9
  token/fold slice passed independently; public row activation still waits on
  the remaining lifecycle/correction, public operational-status, and
  transport gates. F6b6 has implemented the checked status core internally;
  the authorization vocabulary and embedded durable-only
  status are already active.

**Phase B1 disposition — accepted 2026-07-19, closure gap found 2026-07-20 and
repaired 2026-07-21**

The genuine cross-version/rebuild gate and the then-declared graph-level B1
suite passed.
The post-watcher epoch-loss cell closes the clean-ack stale-epoch case at the
adapter boundary, and the post-containment local cost cell remains history-
flat. The configured-RustFS pass is still pre-containment and awaits rerun, so
it supports no current object-store ack-cost claim. This evidence, together
with the dense-scan closure/RSS cell above, covers the private main-only,
unsharded, one-live-writer-process, one-resident-writer and one-exclusive-fold
fixture set.

The evidence does not claim history-flat uncompacted manifest work, a public
latency SLO, group commit, Lance-internal failure injection, or the unavailable
forged pre-claim/pre-put stream-sidecar cell.

Gate R0 correctly found that the old scanner retained sparse backing buffers.
The dense copy releases those buffers and restores the intended 32-MiB logical
dense-slice Arrow closure check; physical RSS remains a separate evidence
tripwire. The near-cap cell now closes. This amendment changed no product
surface. The subsequent v9 slice implements §4.1's private token/attribution
and §4.4's base+token fold core. At that boundary explicit enrollment,
lifecycle management, correction, public row admission, and transport parity
were inactive. Later F7a–F7c activate graph row admission, graph-redacted
status, graph-wide resume, and checked `SEALED` maintenance; per-declaration
lifecycle/abort/rebind and direct SDK control remain inactive. The Cedar
vocabulary and embedded manifest-only status are active, and F6b6 adds the
separate internal checked operational-status core. §4.5.1's B2a profile is
implemented, while §4.5.2's B2b managed-reclamation profile remains optional
and inactive.

### 12.4 Gate R0 — historical bounded-retention no-go; closure repaired

The checked-in `memwal_stream_cost.rs` Gate-R0 cells:

- pin the result to surveyed Lance revision
  `cec0b7dffe2d85c7e66dbe9d1f3891c297903a1d`;
- strictly inventory every currently listed MemWAL object into a known class,
  compare the set with the latest shard-manifest generation references, and
  prove every earlier listed immutable path retains the same class and size;
- sweep one/four/eight success-only folds and preserve their cumulative
  current-object growth;
- prove a retry after the referenced cut reuses the same generation root; and
- use deterministic high-entropy data for the legal near-cap physical-output
  cell instead of a compression-friendly repeated value.

The 2026-07-20 result remains historical evidence that stock RC.1 cannot support
a *bounded* retain-all promise: ordinary listing is not provider billing or
incomplete-multipart inventory, and Lance supplies neither a durable cross-open
materialization-attempt receipt/cap nor a source-derived physical-output
envelope. Those findings must be revisited before any future storage bound is
claimed. They are not blockers for unbounded B2a.

The high-entropy cell now proves the exact B2-attributed boundary through the
real adapter: 3,743 payload bytes per row is rejected effect-free at
33,558,528 bytes, while 3,742 is admitted at 33,550,336 bytes. It expects
successful closure, complete row visibility, one base-table effect, one
`__manifest` visibility point, and no remaining recovery sidecar. It preserves
the invariant that every earlier listed immutable path keeps the same
path/class/size. The local RSS child's recorded reference run measured a
286,441,472-byte fold delta and enforces a 384-MiB CI
**remeasurement** tripwire
for one exclusive fold. That tripwire is not a runtime hard allocator limit.
Configured RustFS remains a post-merge/tag regression signal and is not used to
invent a storage bound.

### 12.5 Phase B2a — unbounded retain-all/no-GC gate implemented

B2a is the selected first profile. Its private implementation gate was
completed on 2026-07-21 and is deliberately narrow:

- retain every canonical durable `_mem_wal` object and make every OmniGraph
  cleanup/repair path structurally incapable of deleting or reclassifying it;
  Lance-owned losing atomic-CAS temp-file cleanup remains permitted;
- preserve the existing 8,192-row/32-MiB logical generation limit, one resident
  writer, one exclusive fold, bounded queues/deadlines/retries, and dense near-
  cap closure evidence;
- resolve or refuse every relevant manifest/recovery authority operation before
  claim, put, fold, correction, quiesce, or resume; never infer ownership from
  listings or path shape;
- prove cold replay, fold-only retry, strict-block retention, and every existing
  acknowledgement/fold crash boundary while unreferenced materialization
  residue remains retained and no production path descends into, reads,
  mutates, deletes, or adopts its subtree; and
- expose retained-object measurements only as advisory diagnostics, with no
  file/object/byte limit, quota, reservation, aggregate receipt cap,
  `GraphHistoryBudget`, or materialization-attempt receipt requirement.

The checked-in result is:

- one AST/source guard inventories the only production `_mem_wal` literal
  owners, keeps the raw classifier module-private, forbids reclamation/adoption
  symbols and destructive primitives in the adapter, and keeps generic
  maintenance unaware of the namespace. It is defense in depth beside Rust
  visibility, exact cleanup call-site guards, and runtime evidence—not a claim
  of whole-program alias/dataflow analysis;
- real object-store write refusal covers effect-free cold claim,
  post-invocation WAL `AckUnknown`, and post-cut `RecoveryRequired`. Complete
  and partial randomized generation output remains unreferenced and retained;
  blocked admission, authoritative retry, and cold reopen perform no object
  access at or below either orphan root. Retry publishes one fresh root, never
  the orphan, and configured RustFS repeats the complete-output cell;
- the shared fail-closed inventory is the single test authority for canonical
  WAL, shard-manifest, and generation paths. Unknown/malformed paths or broken
  manifest authority fail rather than becoming residue evidence; and
- the B2a cost instrument separates warm acknowledgement, cold reopen/replay,
  fold, and visibility probe at 1/8 generations in CI and 1/8/32/128 locally
  and on configured RustFS on demand. Older roots receive zero reads, writes,
  or deletes and canonical MemWAL delete requests remain zero. Local
  shard-manifest CAS may delete only validated `.binpb.tmp.<uuid>` staging.

The historical pre-B2 1→128 sweep recorded flat aggregate warm-ack operation
counts (local: 9 table reads, 2 writes, 21 adapter operations; RustFS: 12, 1,
and 21), while bytes read from growing shard authority increased from 351 to
16,521. B2's mandatory exact token authority makes that old aggregate
flatness claim inapplicable. The current local 1→8 CI cell partitions the
tracked table-store requests: the actual MemWAL warm-ack operation counts
remain flat at 9 reads and 2 writes, token-authority lookup grows 2→8 reads,
aggregate tracked reads therefore grow 11→17, adapter operations remain 28→28,
and every older retained generation root receives zero IO. Base-table and
token-authority work stay separately visible rather than being attributed to
MemWAL history.
Advisory listed bytes, wall times, and whole-process RSS are printed as
diagnostics only and enforce no product threshold.

This B2a result itself added no schema or product surface. The subsequent
private B2-common row/fold slice activated schema v9; F3f later added the narrow
stopped/offline DataBlock exit, F7a later activated the graph-native served row
caller plus HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI parity, and F7b activated the graph-redacted
checked status route and remote CLI. F7c activated selector-free graph-wide
resume and checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize through those served
transports. Per-declaration/general lifecycle control including abort-drain,
rebind, `AuthorityBlock` repair, and direct SDK status/control remain §12.6
work. F6b6 implements the checked operational core; the
authorization/manifest-status slice shipped earlier under §4.7.

### 12.6 Private B2-common implementation and remaining public/B2b gates

The private §12.5 B2a gate and the private B2 row/fold core have passed. The
implemented core covers schema v9/config-v3/state-v2 format activation,
canonical payload/token derivation, trusted row attribution, graph-global token
authority, stale-authority admission revalidation, same-generation chaining,
recovery-v12 exact base+token folding, durable graph-commit attribution, and
genuine v8↔v9 refusal/rebuild. F3e later activated the cluster/offline
retirement/export escape for a verified current-`WITHDRAWN` cut; F3f adds
exact stopped/offline `DataBlock` show/correct with recovery-v20, and F5b adds
current `DEAD_LETTERED`, selected-token inspection/export, ordinary successors,
and three-disposition retirement through recovery-v21. F7a activates the
selected profile's graph-native served row bridge, lazy private prepare,
cancellation ownership, and HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI parity. F7b activates the
graph-redacted checked operational-status HTTP/OpenAPI route and remote CLI.
F7c activates selector-free graph-wide resume and checked `SEALED`
EnsureIndices/Optimize through HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI. Explicit lane
enrollment, per-declaration/general lifecycle controls including abort-drain,
public rebind, `AuthorityBlock` repair, and direct SDK stream ingress/status/
control remain inactive.
F6b6 implements the underlying checked operational-status core.
Cold-replay and flushed-LWW accounting plus exact oldest-uncovered
age are explicitly unavailable. `DISABLING` uses explicit checked cluster-
apply status authority; all within-envelope sidecars are reported and rebuild-
blocking, while an over-bound discovery refuses the whole status. Likewise,
physical movement becomes unavailable only when an exact canonical-main
recovery participant outcome owns it. The
graph-scoped Cedar vocabulary, `stream_manage`-gated enablement, and embedded
manifest-only status are already active under §4.7. This section also
owns B2b's optional managed-reclamation gates; B2a does not need any B2b-only
bullet.
The design does not waive the
persistent escape requirement: a user must never be left with a table that
ordinary writers refuse but cannot be corrected, quiesced, or rebuilt.

- **Graph row surface activated in F7a; graph-wide controls activated in F7c:**
  `@stream(mode="upsert", on_reject="strict")` production first use, the
  served client, HTTP, remote CLI, and OpenAPI all route through the same
  private core. `stream_ingest` has one production graph caller;
  `stream_manage` also gates F7c's selector-free graph-wide resume and checked
  `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize. Existing
  `/ingest` behavior must remain
  compatible. The full surface requires embedded/remote command parity; the
  selected §4.7 profile instead tests served/remote success against the exact
  embedded/direct refusal.
  Accepted-schema and runtime guards must refuse `@stream` on a type requiring
  `@embed` or any external/provider-derived field; caller-supplied physical
  vectors must round-trip without provider invocation.
- **Private prepare proof; no enrollment product surface:** the full
  non-experimental profile retains
  §3/§4.6's explicit `/enroll`, `stream_manage`, and request-level
  `StreamNotEnrolled` contract. The selected experimental profile instead
  requires P2's `stream_ingest`-authorized graph challenge plus lazy private
  prepare: complete graph witness before body ownership and exact table
  eligibility/current-HEAD/lifecycle-absence evidence before enrollment;
  effect-free missing/stale graph-token handling; actor-bound internal request ID/intent;
  same/different-intent and lost-result receipt replay; bounded
  `already_enrolled` for an existing lane; concurrent first-prepare CAS;
  engine-owned stream incarnation injection; and graph-redacted refusal on
  stale private authority. Tests cover every selected-profile
  bootstrap/shard/lifecycle crash boundary plus Cedar/served/remote success and
  embedded/direct refusal. B2b additionally covers every genesis
  body/pointer/new-details crash boundary. The feature-gated engine proof now
  covers the graph challenge and recovery-v14 enrollment subset; F7a exposes
  row transport, while public lane enrollment remains intentionally absent.
- **Public graph acknowledgement adapter activated in F7a:** the response is
  status-only and caller-ordered. It maps each private durable batch result back
  to its caller ordinal and may report only graph-logical kind/type/id,
  `write_id`, safe confirmed/current/unconfirmed token evidence, and bounded
  blocker/limit fields—not stream incarnation, binding, WAL position,
  generation, Lance `batch_positions`, or recovery/object identity. Only
  durable/current outcomes may report a confirmed token; `ack_unknown` labels
  its candidate unconfirmed, while invalid and uninvoked outcomes mint neither.
  Every exact response variant in §4.6 has a schema. The existing private F4
  adapter continues to own contiguous physical-run boundaries around invalid
  lines and token dispositions plus its bounded reorder buffer; F7a adds the
  graph redaction and incremental transport. Existing engine tests cover
  partially full generations, row/logical-memory and queue/deadline limits,
  intrinsically oversized rows, authority/lifecycle/recovery movement, and
  stopped-tail and cancellation precedence. Served tests pin incremental mixed
  graph rows, redaction, and the bodyless precondition refusals. No handler
  converts partial NDJSON success into an HTTP error.
- **Implemented privately:** schema v9/config-v3/state-v2 provisions the hidden
  row metadata and manifest-selected token dataset. Canonical payload/token
  digests bind accepted schema, table/key identity, stream incarnation,
  predecessor, write ID, trusted contributor, and normalized payload. After
  acquiring shared admission and the same-key queue, admission recaptures live
  schema/binding/lifecycle/HEAD/token authority before `put_no_wait`; a stale
  provisional capture is effect-free. Current-token mismatch,
  stream-incarnation mismatch, reused write ID with a different digest/actor,
  exact retry, and same-generation chains are typed and tested. Recovery-v12
  owns exact pre-minted base and `_stream_tokens.lance` transactions, planned
  token winners, state-v2 outcome, fixed lineage, and attribution. Only exact
  base+token may publish both pointers and the graph-commit fold commitment;
  exact base-only recovery may complete only the planned token effect. V11 is
  historical and refused under v9. The graph-global token gate and
  release-all-gates/restart rule cover every manifest writer.
- **Still inactive at the product boundary:** embedded/direct SDK row ingress,
  checked status/control parity, public per-declaration lifecycle/abort/rebind,
  and public lane enrollment. Graph-redacted status and selector-free graph-wide
  resume/checked `SEALED` maintenance are active only through HTTP/OpenAPI and
  the remote CLI.
  Any later SDK or control surface must preserve the graph-only boundary and
  the token/redaction rules above; it cannot promote the private lane adapter
  into a user-visible API.
- **Operator controls:** two-step same-format `retire-for-rebuild` plan/confirm
  is active only as a narrow cluster/offline support surface; it has no served
  HTTP/OpenAPI equivalent. Current dead-letter list/payload export is likewise
  active only under stopped/offline cluster control and walks the selected
  token version rather than object prefixes. F6b1 lets exact terminal cluster/
  server boot mint a checked export-only authority and exposes only a doc-
  hidden immutable engine cut. F6b5 routes that cut through the existing served
  HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI export surface; it adds no status fields. F7b exposes
  a graph-redacted HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI view of F6b6's checked read-only
  operational-status core. F7c exposes graph-wide resume and checked `SEALED`
  EnsureIndices/Optimize through the same served transports without exposing a
  declaration/table/lane selector. The remaining minimum controls—explicit fold,
  persistent quiesce, per-declaration abort-drain, rebuild execution, general data
  correction, and authority repair—remain inactive. Direct SDK checked status
  and control also remain inactive.
  Embedded durable-only status is already active. F6a adds a separate typed,
  failpoints-only process-local advisory driver snapshot for tests; it does not
  add fields to that durable projection, and pending triggers are not backlog.
  Full status must take an
  exclusive cut, settle
  owners without mutating recovery, and
  include exact lifecycle/binding/revision, epoch, advisory pending
  generations/bytes, a bounded current block view, current operation/claim
  summaries, last fold summary, and strict-blocked state. Every lane-scoped
  externally initiated mutating call after enrollment must carry an operation
  ID and expected lifecycle revision; root-wide authority retirement instead
  carries `retirement_id`, expected profile revision, and the exact plan digest.
  Same-ID/same-digest must return the complete bounded terminal receipt,
  same-ID/different-digest must conflict, and a stale revision must never
  retarget. Quiesce must require a caller drain ID, have a
  crash-safe cut, never record terminal success at the initial
  `DRAINING` CAS, never auto-reopen, and
  prove the empty cut plus token/base parity and zero current terminal authority
  before normal ordinary export/cutover. Retirement instead requires terminal
  `DISABLED`, the complete exact root cut, and its irreversible receipt before
  row-only export with terminal authority. Resume
  must revalidate the same binding, no-named-branch topology, and epoch authority
  before advancing its epoch. Abort-drain may return `DRAINING -> OPEN` only
  when no guarded operation began, every owner settled, and no unmerged residue
  or strict block remains. Either correction kind must clear only its matching
  tagged block, preserve `DRAINING` and the current goal plus any exact
  `DisableDrainAdoption` override, and never itself reopen. Tests must lose an
  authority-correction response after its
  block disappears and recover the terminal receipt before revision/block
  lookup. They must delay a quiesce/resume retry across a later cycle and prove
  receipt/stale-revision handling. They must hold two streams strict-blocked
  simultaneously, then close one while preserving the other's independent
  block/correction/abort-drain/requiesce/`SEALED` authority. The WAL watermark
  must never be reported as a whole-graph history bound.
F3e's landed evidence is intentionally smaller than the complete EXP/F6 gate:
the recovery-v19 suite pins closed grammar, exact N+1 receipt roll-forward,
lineage/audit neutrality, receipt-bearing retired export, and writer refusal;
cluster/CLI tests pin offline preflight; the genuine v16↔v17 fence pins the
format boundary. F3f adds exact DataBlock reconstruction/pagination,
replacement and marker-only withdrawal, receipt-first replay, the arm-only /
base-only / both-effects recovery cells, stopped/offline cluster/CLI preflight,
and the genuine v17↔v18 fence. Those focused cells are sufficient for the
narrow offline `WITHDRAWN` path. F5b adds focused mixed/all-diverted fold,
exact retry/ordinary successor, one-object binding, selected-token list/export,
and three-disposition retirement evidence. The genuine v18↔v19 adjacent binary
cell pins both refusals, ordinary rebuild fidelity, and import of frozen final-
v18 retirement receipt-v1 bytes without authority transfer. The broader race/
failpoint/freeze/export
matrix below remains required before the remaining control surfaces activate;
F7a's narrower served-ingress evidence is called out separately, and none of
this activates `AuthorityBlock` repair.

- V17 authority-retirement planning begins with at least one current
  `WITHDRAWN` token whose graph key is absent or retains its prior value.
  Repeating plan across reopen returns the same digest and bounded counts. A
  structural plan assertion proves the implementation binds the exact
  manifest-selected pre-retirement token version/transaction witness, scans in
  bounded batches, and never `SortExec`s, materializes a terminal-key vector,
  walks ledger history, or lists raw WAL/object prefixes. Injected movement of
  the manifest/branch cut, profile revision, any
  binding/lifecycle/`SEALED` proof, base parity, token pointer, or relevant
  recovery makes confirmation effect-free `StreamRetirementPlanChanged`.
- Authority-retirement failpoints cover pre-arm refusal,
  sidecar-armed-before-ledger, ledger-effect-before-manifest-CAS,
  manifest-CAS-before-finalization, and lost terminal response. Pre-arm refusal
  is effect-free; once durably armed, recovery may only roll forward the exact
  plan. Same graph/kind/ID plus digest returns the immutable receipt, the same
  ID with another digest conflicts, and the same plan/ID under another actor
  conflicts because the confirmed operation digest differs. A fresh ID after
  `RETIRED` returns typed `StreamAuthorityRetired`. The sole CAS selects the receipt-bearing
  token pointer, `RETIRED` profile row, retirement fields, and profile
  receipt-chain commitment together while advancing no live branch head or
  graph lineage. Race an armed pre-CAS authority-retirement sidecar with enable
  and disable apply: the graph-global recovery barrier must exactly finalize
  `RETIRED` or refuse before either profile CAS.
- A freeze matrix proves `RETIRED` refuses before effect for
  Mutation/Load/delete and `_as`, SchemaApply, BranchMerge, branch
  create/delete, every profile transition/refinement,
  Optimize/EnsureIndices/Repair/Cleanup,
  prepare/admission, quiesce/resume, correction/fold,
  enrollment/rebind, and every new recovery arm; only exact finalization of the
  already-armed authority-retirement sidecar is allowed. Read/query/status and
  repeated export of the recorded cut remain available.
- Ambient ordinary export of an enrolled `DISABLED` graph now returns
  `StreamingRequiresClusterRuntime` before output. The existing receipt-
  verified `RETIRED` ambient export remains a compatibility rebuild bridge,
  serialized by the same exclusive root gate alongside F6b5's checked served
  route.
  Through F6b1's checked
  terminal seam, an ordinary `DISABLED` graph with current terminal authority
  returns `StreamExportBlocked` before output, while a `RETIRED` graph can
  repeatedly export its exact recorded cut and receipt. Capture holds every
  profile/admission/schema/branch/token/table gate through filter and authority
  validation, freezes the accepted catalog and exact selected table versions,
  then releases the gates into a move-only cut that retains the exclusive root
  gate through output. A concurrent later writer cannot retarget that cut,
  while branch create/create-from/delete, schema apply, cleanup, and supported
  whole-root deletion take the shared side and cannot remove or reuse a
  selected path/version.
  Fresh
  init/load round-trips logical rows but imports no token, lifecycle,
  enrollment, receipt, or dead-letter authority. The source token rows, receipt
  ledger, WAL/dead-letter artifacts, and base versions remain byte-for-byte
  authoritative and retained. A two-live-branch cell proves each export keeps
  the same root receipt and ordered member-digest proof while emitting a
  distinct, recomputable `branch_member` witness and selected index for the
  chosen frozen branch. Any later enrollment
  of the fresh
  graph mints a new stream incarnation; an old-incarnation request is effect-free
  `StreamBindingChanged`.
  A declared terminal graph, previously unmanaged `RETIRED` graph, or
  previously unmanaged enrolled `DISABLED` graph can mint the narrow
  `CheckedClusterServedExportAuthority`; no fold delegation, supervisor, or
  admission authority is implied. This evidence is
  engine/control-authority only in F6b1; F6b5 owns the existing public export
  handler, bounded chunk queue/reservation, deadline, stall/disconnect behavior,
  and HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI parity.
- F5 repeats the matrix with `WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED` and activates
  `DEAD_LETTERED` only after the following exact cells are green:
  1. exact retry after restart returns the same `DEAD_LETTERED` result while
     the terminal token remains current;
  2. the next occurrence must name that terminal token as predecessor;
  3. an older predecessor cannot resurrect or bypass the key;
  4. an all-diverted fold publishes terminal token and fold-attribution
     authority without a base-row effect;
  5. a lost object-PUT result is recovered by deterministic identity, length,
     and digest;
  6. an existing object with different bytes fails closed;
  7. an over-limit payload installs `DataBlock` before any object effect;
  8. ordinary export blocks while terminal authority is current;
  9. a successful ordinary correction or explicit retirement releases the
     block; and
  10. list/export streams the selected current-token version with bounded
      materialization and never depends on prefix listing or graph-history
      reconstruction.
  Retirement pins the immutable token-version witness, does not require a
  special replay protocol, and never deletes the canonical object. The
  same-format source binary performs retirement/export before the refusing
  successor format is used.
- **Future bounded-root profile only:** a separately accepted
  `GraphHistoryBudget` amendment must force every manifest writer through one
  reserve-first gate, account for complete physical effects and recovery, and
  prove crash-safe settlement and independent stream closure reserves. None of
  those tests gates unbounded retain-all.
- Every public batch must durably record its authenticated contributor before
  rows can become unattributable, and the fold audit must consume that
  evidence. A current `WITHDRAWN` token must remain durable even when the graph
  row is absent; neither attribution nor sequencing may be inferred from MemTable positions,
  mutable WAL statistics, age, raw path shape, or benchmark maxima.
- **B2b only:** the reviewed Lance inspect/plan/execute patch, durable attempt/receipt,
  post-success WAL fence check, bounded history checkpoint, and enforced
  retained-byte/object admission watermark bound growth. Exact inventory
  requires strong HEAD/GET/LIST visibility after PUT/DELETE plus exact multipart
  accounting/abort, or Lance-owned durable accounting.
- Admission cancellation and server shutdown must not abandon an in-flight
  durability waiter. A background-owned admission task must reach a durable
  outcome or typed `AckUnknown`. Status/replay must preserve possible residue
  but never claim to reconcile that caller's attempt.
- The public retry contract must prevent an ambiguous `X(id)`, newer durable
  `Y(id)`, retry `X(id)` sequence from silently restoring the stale `X` value.
  Tests must pin that exact interleaving, stream-incarnation reset, historic UUID
  reuse with a newer predecessor, actor change, same-generation chains across
  separate durable puts, the one-fresh-occurrence-per-key physical-run rule,
  reachable same-key `new/already/conflict`, and mixed-key
  `new/conflict/new` within one request, across separate requests, after restart,
  and through correction. One-row LWW cardinality
  alone must not be accepted as semantic idempotency.
- Correction tests must cover `REPLACE` and `WITHDRAW` over an exact blocked cut,
  lost fold response/restart followed by paginated block inspection, exact
  offending-key/token/action view digest, cursor/block movement, permission
  refusal, missing-cut corruption, multiple violations for one key across
  count/byte-capped pages with stable full-entry ordering, and the 8,192-row
  planning bound,
  engine-derived canonical plan digest plus actor binding, same/different
  correction-ID replay, stale block token, unknown key, exact row/byte and
  response-page bounds, cold-replay reconstruction of terminal receipts, and
  no-generation quiesce through `SEALED` rebuild. They must also cover
  8,192 distinct corrected current-token rows plus the separately bounded one-
  row receipt transaction, depth-8,192 replacement to exact maximum 8,193,
  concurrent fold/resume, and
  every sidecar/effect/publication crash boundary. No second generation,
  skip-invalid path, or graph delete may be admitted.
- Quiesce tests must cover crashes before/after `OPEN -> DRAINING`, epoch claim,
  seal/drain, each fold, equal descriptor/top-level witness advancement,
  historical and selected-profile-authenticated current fence sentinels,
  strict-block summary,
  engine-minted failure-drain identity/actor before and after its conditional
  CAS, empty proof, and `SEALED` publication. Status tests must cover concurrent
  put/flush/selected-profile retention exclusion. Resume and abort-drain tests must cover
  arm/claim/confirm/CAS/finalize,
  caller operation-ID/expected-revision retry, same-ID/different-intent,
  delayed retry after a later drain/resume cycle, named-branch refusal, strict-
  block refusal, reopen, and lost replies. Every selected-profile claim crashes
  at its declared authority/effect boundaries and prove exact classification
  before admitting a put. Under B2b, cold open, quiesce, resume/abort, and
  checkpoint additionally cover reclaim-successor sentinels and crash at
  patched claim-attempt/sentinel/manifest
  boundaries and must prove that their ordinary sentinel-first claims preserve the
  prior replay cursor and classify its full tail; only the whole-cut reclaim
  case may advance that cursor to its new sentinel. Quiesce must settle and
  publish every retention sidecar before the final proof; B2b
  reclaim/checkpoint must refuse while `SEALED`, and resume must consume rather than
  mutate the old proof. `SEALED` must never auto-open.
- **B2b only:** reclamation tests must cover stock-cleanup non-ownership, the stale-writer deleted
  successor-sentinel slot, exact local/RustFS inventory, HEAD/GET/LIST and
  multipart capability refusal or durable accounting, and explicit refusal of
  versioned/soft-delete/Object-Lock storage unless every retained version,
  delete marker, locked byte, and multipart upload is exactly accounted and
  eligible versions are permanently removed,
  authoritative-checkpoint-plus-successor-chain orphan classes, exact empty
  generation/whole replay cut with no data tail, stale plan and terminal
  `aborted_no_effect` plus fresh-ID replan, prune CAS, partial delete, lost
  receipt, and attempt/receipt replay. Successor planning binds the maximum
  authenticated tail position rather than only the data cutoff, refuses
  overflow/collision, and proves the successor manifest preserves the exact
  monotonic `current_generation` with consistent base merge coverage. They
  crash after successor sentinel but before CAS and prove writer-claim refusal
  plus open-barrier recovery; exercise
  missing/stale hints, genesis body/pointer/details first publication, and every
  later bootstrap-pointer crash boundary. Checkpoint tests fold terminal
  ordinary-claim plus reclaim receipts, terminal generation/materialization/
  settlement and control-ledger records, every still-charged reservation, and
  historical-sentinel authority into the body before deleting old records; old
  IDs return `ReceiptExpired`, `ClaimReceiptExpired`, or `ReservationExpired`,
  while the same UUID in a new checkpoint epoch is distinct. A source-derived/
  enforced reservation is tested across bounded
  materialization attempts and repeated crash-before-multipart-complete. Its
  per-binding reserve-first ledger crashes before/after reserve, first WAL or
  upload effect, exact settlement, and reclaim release; cold open reconstructs
  it, concurrent shards cannot double-reserve, and unowned effects fail closed.
  Capped control attempts/receipts/checkpoint-body orphans cannot consume the
  emergency pool; control headroom still allows same-ID recovery,
  quiesce/seal, reclaim, and checkpoint at the full admission watermark.
  Measurements validate but do not create the bound, and budget is never
  released optimistically.
- Base B2 keeps every writer refused at `SEALED`. Experimental §4.7 P7 narrows
  that only for explicitly integrated content-preserving Optimize and
  EnsureIndices whose recovery atomically updates the witness/proof, plus the
  separately checked terminal-disabled physical-rebind owner. Productive
  SchemaApply, Mutation/Load, BranchMerge, cleanup, adoption, and every
  unintegrated writer remain refused. EXP schema evolution uses checked
  export/rebuild into a fresh graph. Phase D still owns automatic operation
  drain and any broader token-aware direct-write/schema integration.
- `SEALED` alone does not authorize export/rebuild after public terminal
  disposition. Preflight accepts only ordinary `DISABLED` plus token/base
  parity and zero current `DEAD_LETTERED | WITHDRAWN`, or `RETIRED` plus the
  exact selected authority-retirement receipt/profile-chain/logical-cut match.
  The retired case verifies its committed cut without rerunning the ordinary
  terminal-token rejection. Any terminal token in the ordinary case returns
  `StreamExportBlocked`. Dead-letter payload export is not a rebuild import
  contract.
- **Implemented v8↔v9 gate:** CI builds the immutable final-v8 binary, proves
  old-binary/new-format and new-binary/old-format refusal, and performs an
  export/init/load rebuild that preserves logical rows, caller-supplied vectors,
  and exact-`id` PK metadata while omitting hidden trusted stream metadata.
  Future public rebuild tests must additionally prove acknowledged rows survive
  only after quiesce/fold and fail closed when one remains unfolded. Under B2b,
  compatibility tests must prove stock RC.1 rejects the
  patched new MemWAL details type URL/system-index kind rather than ignoring a
  field or falling back to a latest-version hint. A future bounded-root
  amendment must separately own `GraphHistoryBudget` bootstrap, mismatch,
  crash, and cap-too-small refusal tests; those are not v9/B2a activation gates.

### 12.7 Later expansion gates

- Phase C defines the full restart-stable reject-row identity, using B2's
  durable contributor attribution, before adding `_ingest_rejects`, general
  reject retention, richer status, or configurable registry/memory/deadline
  limits. Section 4.7 P4 separately pulls forward its bounded terminal
  object-form subset. The old
  `(table, shard, generation, wal_position)` tuple is not accepted as identity.
- Phase D integrates **automatic** drain/resume orchestration with SchemaApply,
  branches, Optimize, Repair, Cleanup, and physical rebind. Experimental P7
  separately pulls forward only the explicit same-binding maintenance and
  terminal-disabled physical-rebind subset; EXP schema changes remain
  fresh-target rebuilds. A
  rematerialized table stays `SEALED` until an exact sidecar-covered rebind
  publishes a new namespace and proof; a separate resume opens it.
- Phase E fresh reads race capture with fold/GC and rebind, retain generation
  guards through execution, exclude merged generations, and document their
  cross-table consistency boundary.
- Phase F multi-shard support requires a one-key-one-shard proof and a fresh
  Lance audit. Phase G overlapping-process ownership/failover still requires a
  public exact enrollment receipt plus cross-process seal/reopen, or a
  separately accepted distributed fence with adversarial recovery evidence.
- Surface, format, and S3/RustFS guards rerun before every Lance bump.

## 13. Phasing

In the compact phase table, “root slot” names the one export position: export
owns the root gate exclusively; destructive controls use its shared side and
remain concurrent with one another.

| Phase | Content | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | production-neutral public-surface enrollment/witness classifier; no schema, API, sidecar, or format activation | **Passed 2026-07-18:** 14 substantive local cells, complete six-attempt zero-list 8/80 cost shape, Unix no-list/error tripwire, and one non-vacuous configured RustFS positive-plus-negative cell (§12.1) |
| A | bounded main/unsharded/single-live-writer enrollment adapter, all-lifecycle effect exclusion with only the `SEALED` native-branch exception, lifecycle/admission lease, then graph-format capability/refusal and strict rebuild | **Implemented 2026-07-18 (§12.2):** internal schema v7, recovery-v10 enrollment, durable lifecycle CAS, process-local exclusion, crash/partial-format refusal, and genuine v6↔v7 strand evidence; no public enrollment or row path |
| B1 | **Implemented privately 2026-07-19; acknowledgement containment added 2026-07-20; widest-shape closure repaired 2026-07-21:** internal schema v8/config-v2, root-scoped one-generation admission worker, durability-watcher success followed by a same-writer post-durability epoch check, conservative active-state reopen/replay, the pinned RC.1 replay-watermark bridge, and one explicit strict RFC-022 fold; no production caller | The graph-level behavior/crash/race suite and genuine v7↔v8 refusal/rebuild remain green. Fold charges logical dense-slice Arrow bytes and copies each scanner emission into dense owned arrays. The legal 8,192-row high-entropy near-cap generation folds and publishes exactly once without changing the logical 32-MiB admission cap; physical RSS is guarded only by the 384-MiB remeasurement tripwire (§12.4). Recovery-v11 is historical under the current v19 graph format |
| R0 | production-neutral retained-growth/source audit; current-object census; referenced-cut retry; legal high-entropy near-cap materialize/fold cell; no schema, public caller, or deletion | **Historical bounded-retention no-go 2026-07-20; disposition amended 2026-07-21 (§0.2/§12.4):** RC.1 still exposes neither a complete reserve-first physical envelope/receipt nor a durable cross-open randomized-attempt cap. Those facts prohibit a finite storage promise but do not block selected unbounded retain-all. The formerly red widest cell is now green locally and on the configured-RustFS CI path; current-object observations remain advisory retention evidence, not provider billing/accounting |
| B2a | selected unbounded retain-all/no-GC profile on stock Lance | **Private gate implemented 2026-07-21 (§12.5):** no OmniGraph byte/object/file/history quota; zero canonical `_mem_wal` deletion; complete/partial provider residue remains retained, unreferenced, and untouched below its root through retry/reopen; provider failures are loud; local/configured-RustFS history sweeps are advisory. This gate itself activated no schema or product surface; the later private B2-common slice activates v9 |
| B2b | candidate managed-reclamation retention profile | Inactive. Requires the Lance-owned durable inspect/plan/execute + receipt, post-success fencing, bounded checkpoint/inventory/accounting, local/RustFS enforced-bound validation, and the profile-specific crash matrix (§4.5.2/§12.6). Passing it alone activates no product surface |
| B2-common | schema v9/config-v3/state-v2, compare-and-chain token/attribution, graph-global token authority, recovery-v12 base+token fold; then explicit enrollment, revision-fenced lifecycle/correction/full status, SDK row/control methods, HTTP, CLI, and OpenAPI | **Private row/fold subset implemented 2026-07-22 (§11/§12.6):** canonical digests, hidden attribution, stale-authority revalidation after shared admission, same-generation chains, exact two-participant recovery/publication, durable fold attribution, retain-all, and genuine v8↔v9 refusal/rebuild are green. Explicit production enrollment and per-declaration/general lifecycle mutation remain inactive. Later EXP slices activate graph-native served row ingress (F7a), the graph-redacted checked HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI status projection (F7b), and selector-free graph-wide resume plus checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize (F7c); direct SDK status/control, per-declaration abort, and public rebind remain inactive. The Cedar vocabulary, embedded manifest-only status, and narrow stopped/offline F3f DataBlock correction also shipped in EXP slices. `GraphHistoryBudget` belongs only to a future bounded/managed profile |
| EXP | experimental cluster-only activation of the §4.7 profile: offline capability-bound enablement, lazy enrollment, caller-supplied vectors, terminal per-key dead letter plus correction, irreversible authority retirement for fresh-root rebuild, SEALED maintenance/rebind, starvation-free serial folding, graph-native served ingress, graph-redacted served status, and graph-wide resume/SEALED maintenance | **Selected 2026-07-27 and amended through F7c (§4.7); F3a–F3f, hidden F4, F5a/F5b0/F5b, F6a–F6b8 evidence subsets, F7a graph ingress, F7b graph status, and F7c graph controls are implemented.** Current v19/token-schema-v3/recovery-v21 publishes deterministic mixed/all-diverted folds, current `DEAD_LETTERED` authority, exact retry/ordinary successor, stopped/offline inspection, and three-disposition retirement. F6b1 freezes an exact-terminal move-only cut; F6b5 connects it to existing served HTTP/remote-client/CLI/OpenAPI export with incremental exact-version scans using approximate Lance targets, strict 64-KiB chunks, complete queue-envelope reservation, pre-header typed refusal, backpressure, and disconnect-safe body-plus-producer ownership. F6b6 adds the checked operational cut with explicit checked `DISABLING` cluster-apply status authority. F6b7 adds a paired failpoints-only exact-selected token-index decision instrument without recovery or production maintenance. Within the hard status envelope status reports every sidecar as rebuild-blocking, while an over-bound discovery refuses the whole cut; it makes only exact sidecar-owned base-HEAD movement physically unavailable and reports cold-replay/flushed-LWW accounting plus exact oldest-uncovered age as unavailable; the public manifest-only status is unchanged. F7a exposes one graph-only mixed node/edge NDJSON route and remote command over the existing checked runtime, hidden lazy enrollment, and resident fold driver. A strong graph-authority ETag gates body ownership; results are graph-logical and redact all table/lane/binding evidence. F7b exposes the logical checked status cut with `read` authorization and `no-store`, omitting physical and opaque control identities. F7c exposes selector-free graph-wide resume and graph-wide checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize over HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI, reusing recovery-v15/v16/v17 without a new coordinator or format strand. Public lane enrollment, per-declaration/general lifecycle/abort, public rebind, direct SDK parity, and unreachable `AuthorityBlock` repair remain inactive. F6b7's bounded NO-GO applies only to the uncompacted profile-cycle fixture and schedules no standalone production token-index reconciler; remeasurement begins beyond 260 uncovered fragments, after a Lance/index-grammar change, or before considering graph-manifest-compacted or checked-Optimize-coupled maintenance. |
| C | restart-stable reject-row identity, atomic dead letter, richer status, and evidence-backed configurable bounds | reject crash matrix; reject-retention proof; backpressure and RSS/latency evidence. The §4.7 profile pulls a bounded object-form dead-letter subset forward using the §4.1 token as reject identity |
| D | automatic operation drain, broader schema/branch/upgrade integration, and orchestrated rematerialization rebind beyond P7's explicit bridge | two-coordinator race, old/new physical-binding crash matrix, and format-transition suite |
| E | fresh cuts and maintained-index reads; cross-process `Fresh` ships only if the substrate generation-retention guard exists (§9), otherwise same-process only | cut consistency; merged-generation exclusion |
| F | multi-shard upsert and stream deletes | one-key-one-shard proof; Lance re-audit |
| G | overlapping-process ownership/failover | public exact enrollment receipt plus cross-process seal/reopen, or a separately accepted distributed fence; adversarial multi-process recovery evidence |
