# Architecture

OmniGraph is a typed property-graph engine built as a coordination layer over many Lance datasets, with Git-style branches and commits across the whole graph, multi-modal querying (vector + FTS + BM25 + RRF + graph traversal) in one runtime, an HTTP server with Cedar policy, and a CLI driven by a per-operator `~/.omnigraph/config.yaml` plus team-owned cluster directories.

## Reading guide

Three views, increasing zoom:

1. **System context** — what OmniGraph is and what it touches.
2. **Layer view** — the eight-layer stack inside one OmniGraph process.
3. **Component zoom-ins** — what's inside each layer.

For runtime flows (read query, mutation), see [`docs/dev/execution.md`](execution.md). For the on-disk layout of a graph, see [`docs/user/storage.md`](../user/concepts/storage.md).

L1 (orange in the diagrams) is what we inherit from Lance; L2 (blue) is what OmniGraph adds. The L1/L2 framing is also called out in prose at the bottom of this doc.

OmniGraph runs as a single process (one binary, multiple crates). External dependencies are the embedding APIs (called during ingest and at query-time normalization), Cedar (called for every privileged action), and an object store (everything OmniGraph persists lands here).

## Layer view

Inside the OmniGraph process, work flows through these layers:

    engine -- "scan / write request" --> storage
    storage -- "Stream of RecordBatch" --> engine
    storage -- "Lance API calls" --> lance_layer
    lance_layer -- bytes --> object_store
```

The storage seam is partly aspirational. `TableStorage` exists as the sealed staged-write trait, but capability/stat surfaces and full call-site migration are still roadmap. The diagram shows the intended boundary.

## Component zoom-ins

### Compiler — `omnigraph-compiler`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef l2 fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#1e6aa8,color:#000

    src[".gq source"]:::l2
    p[parser Pest<br/>query.pest · schema.pest]:::l2
    ast[AST<br/>QueryDecl · Mutation · Schema]:::l2
    cat[catalog<br/>NodeType · EdgeType · Interface]:::l2
    tc[typecheck<br/>typecheck_query]:::l2
    low[lower<br/>lower_query]:::l2
    ir[IROp pipeline<br/>NodeScan · Expand · Filter · AntiJoin]:::l2

    src --> p --> ast --> tc
    cat --> tc
    tc --> low --> ir
```

The compiler crate has zero Lance dependency. It owns the schema language, the query language, and the AST → IR lowering.

Code paths:

- Parser: `crates/omnigraph-compiler/src/query/parser.rs`, `crates/omnigraph-compiler/src/query/query.pest`
- Typecheck: `crates/omnigraph-compiler/src/query/typecheck.rs:83` (`typecheck_query`)
- Lower: `crates/omnigraph-compiler/src/ir/lower.rs:11` (`lower_query`)
- Catalog: `crates/omnigraph-compiler/src/catalog/`

### Engine — `omnigraph` crate

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    classDef l2 fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#1e6aa8,color:#000

    subgraph exec[exec module]
        eq[query · execute_query<br/>query.rs:347]:::l2
        em[mutation · mutate<br/>mutation.rs:511]:::l2
        ld[loader · ingest<br/>loader/mod.rs:74]:::l2
    end

    subgraph state[graph state]
        coord[GraphCoordinator]:::l2
        mr[ManifestCoordinator<br/>db/manifest.rs]:::l2
        cg[CommitGraph<br/>projection of __manifest graph_commit/graph_head rows]:::l2
        stg[MutationStaging<br/>per-query in-memory accumulator<br/>exec/staging.rs]:::l2
    end

    subgraph idx[graph index]
        gi[GraphIndex<br/>CSR/CSC built per query<br/>scoped to traversed edges]:::l2
        rc[RuntimeCache LRU=8<br/>keyed by edge-table identity]:::l2
    end

    subgraph io[Lance I/O]
        ts[table_store]:::l2
        st[storage adapter<br/>storage.rs]:::l2
    end

    eq --> gi
    eq --> ts
    em --> stg
    em --> ts
    ld --> stg
    ld --> ts
    eq --> mr
    em --> mr
    coord --> mr
    coord --> cg
    ts --> st
```

The engine binds the compiler IR to Lance. It owns multi-dataset coordination, the graph topology index, the per-query staging accumulator, and the snapshot/manifest read path.

Code paths:

- Read entry: `Omnigraph::query` at `crates/omnigraph/src/exec/query.rs:7`
- Mutation entry: `Omnigraph::mutate` at `crates/omnigraph/src/exec/mutation.rs:511`
- Manifest commit: `ManifestCoordinator::commit` at `crates/omnigraph/src/db/manifest.rs:280`
- Graph index: `crates/omnigraph/src/graph_index/`
- Loader: `Omnigraph::ingest` at `crates/omnigraph/src/loader/mod.rs:74`

### Mutation atomicity — in-memory accumulator (MR-794)

Inserts and updates inside `mutate_as` and the bulk loader's
Append/Merge modes go through `MutationStaging`
([`crates/omnigraph/src/exec/staging.rs`](../../crates/omnigraph/src/exec/staging.rs)),
a per-query in-memory accumulator. No Lance HEAD advance happens during
op execution; one `stage_*` + `commit_staged` per touched table runs
at end-of-query, then the publisher commits the manifest atomically.

```
op-1 (insert/update) → push RecordBatch → MutationStaging.pending[table]
op-2 (insert/update) → read committed via Lance + pending via DataFusion
                       MemTable (read-your-writes) → push batch
op-N → push batch
─── end of query ───────────────────────────────────────
finalize: per pending table:
   concat batches → stage_append OR stage_merge_insert OR stage_overwrite
                  → commit_staged
publisher: ManifestBatchPublisher::publish (one cross-table CAS)
```

A failed op leaves Lance HEAD untouched on the staged tables: the next
mutation proceeds normally with no drift to reconcile. Concrete
contracts:

- `D₂` parse-time rule: a query is either insert/update-only or
  delete-only. Mixed → reject. Deletes now stage like inserts/updates
  (MR-A: `stage_delete` via Lance 7.0 `DeleteBuilder::execute_uncommitted`),
  so they no longer advance HEAD inline; D₂ is a deliberate boundary
  (constructive XOR destructive per query) that keeps in-query read-your-writes
  unambiguous — compose mixed operations via separate mutations or a branch.
- `LoadMode::Overwrite` uses Lance `Operation::Overwrite` through the
  same staged path. Loader validation runs against the replacement
  in-memory batches before any `commit_staged`, and the publish window is
  covered by `SidecarKind::Load` recovery.
- Read sites consume `TableStore::scan_with_pending`, which Lance-scans
  the committed snapshot at the captured `expected_version` and unions
  with a DataFusion `MemTable` over the pending batches.

This pattern realizes read-your-writes within a multi-statement mutation
and keeps failure scope bounded for inserts/updates by construction at
the writer layer. See [docs/dev/invariants.md](invariants.md) and
[docs/dev/writes.md](writes.md) for the publisher CAS contract this builds on.

### Storage trait — today vs. roadmap

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef now fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#1e6aa8,color:#000
    classDef future fill:#fff,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray:5 5,color:#444

    subgraph today[Today]
        d1[table_store<br/>opens lance::Dataset directly]:::now
        d2[storage.rs<br/>S3 / file URI plumbing]:::now
    end

    subgraph roadmap[Roadmap - storage capabilities]
        t[trait Dataset<br/>schema · stats · placement<br/>capabilities · scan · write]:::future
        impl1[LanceStorage]:::future
        impl2[future test impl]:::future
    end

    today -.-> roadmap
    t --> impl1
    t --> impl2
```

The staged-write trait exists today as `TableStorage`, implemented by `TableStore`. Full engine migration plus capability and statistics surfaces remain roadmap, so the planner cannot yet reason about all pushdown opportunities through a documented trait surface.

### Index lifecycle — today vs. roadmap

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef now fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#1e6aa8,color:#000
    classDef future fill:#fff,stroke:#888,stroke-dasharray:5 5,color:#444

    subgraph today[Today]
        ei[ensure_indices<br/>omnigraph.rs:445]:::now
        manual[called manually<br/>or from optimize]:::now
    end

    subgraph roadmap[Roadmap - manifest reconciler]
        rec[Reconciler<br/>observes manifest]:::future
        diff[coverage diff<br/>fragments − fragment_bitmap]:::future
        wp[worker pool<br/>builds index segments]:::future
    end

    manual --> ei
    today -.-> roadmap
    rec --> diff --> wp
```

Today, indexes are built explicitly via `ensure_indices`. Reads degrade gracefully when index coverage is partial — Lance's scanner unions indexed and scan paths automatically. The roadmap reconciler observes manifest state and converges coverage in the background.

### Server / CLI

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef l2 fill:#e8f4fd,stroke:#1e6aa8,color:#000

    cli[omnigraph CLI<br/>command families]:::l2
    srv_in[Axum HTTP<br/>REST + OpenAPI]:::l2
    auth[Bearer auth<br/>SHA-256 hashed tokens]:::l2
    pol[Cedar policy gate<br/>per request]:::l2
    wl[WorkloadController<br/>per-actor admission]:::l2
    eng[engine API<br/>Arc&lt;Omnigraph&gt;]:::l2
    wq[WriteQueueManager<br/>per-(table, branch)]:::l2

    cli -.-> eng
    srv_in --> auth --> pol --> wl --> eng
    eng --> wq
```

The server applies Cedar policy at the HTTP boundary today. The roadmap, called out in [docs/dev/invariants.md](invariants.md) as a known gap, is to push policy into the planner as predicates. After Cedar, mutating handlers go through `WorkloadController` (per-actor admission cap + byte budget; PR 2 / MR-686) before reaching the engine. The engine itself holds an `Arc<WriteQueueManager>` so concurrent mutations on the same `(table, branch)` serialize at the queue, while disjoint keys run in parallel — see [docs/user/server.md](../user/operations/server.md) "Per-actor admission control" and [docs/dev/writes.md](writes.md). The CLI bypasses the HTTP layer (and admission) and calls the engine API directly.

Code paths:

- Server entry: `crates/omnigraph-server/src/lib.rs`
- Auth: `crates/omnigraph-server/src/auth.rs`
- Policy: `crates/omnigraph-server/src/policy.rs`
- CLI: `crates/omnigraph-cli/src/main.rs`

## L1 / L2 framing

Throughout the docs, capabilities are split into:

- **L1 — Inherited from Lance**: what OmniGraph gets "for free" by sitting on top of the Lance dataset format (columnar Arrow storage, per-dataset versions and branches, index types, `merge_insert`, `compact_files` / `cleanup_old_versions`).
- **L2 — Added by OmniGraph**: typing (schema language), graph semantics, multi-dataset coordination via `__manifest`, graph-level branches and commits, the `.gq` query language and IR, the topology index, the HTTP server, Cedar policy, the CLI.

## Concurrency model

- **MVCC**: every Lance write bumps a per-dataset version; the OmniGraph manifest version coordinates which sub-table versions are visible together.
- **Snapshot isolation**: a query holds one `Snapshot` for its lifetime; concurrent writes don't leak in.
- **Cross-branch isolation**: copy-on-write means readers and writers on different branches don't block each other.
- **Per-query staging**: `mutate_as` and `load` (Append/Merge) accumulate insert/update batches in an in-memory `MutationStaging`; one `stage_*` + `commit_staged` per touched table runs at end-of-query, then the publisher commits the manifest atomically. A mid-query failure leaves Lance HEAD untouched on staged tables. (MR-794; pre-v0.4.0 used a `__run__<id>` staging branch + Run state machine, removed in MR-771.)
- **Schema-apply lock**: `__schema_apply_lock__` system branch serializes schema migrations.
- **Fail-points** (`failpoints` cargo feature): `failpoints::maybe_fail("operation.step")?` in `branch_create`, publish, etc., for deterministic failure injection in tests.

## Workspace crates

- `omnigraph-compiler` — schema and query grammars, catalog, IR, lowering, type checker, lint, migration planner, OpenAI-style embedding client.
- `omnigraph` (engine, published as `omnigraph-engine` on crates.io since v0.2.2) — the Lance-backed runtime: manifest, commit graph, snapshot, exec (incl. per-query `MutationStaging` accumulator), merge, loader, Gemini embedding client.
- `omnigraph-cli` — the `omnigraph` binary.
- `omnigraph-server` — the `omnigraph-server` binary (Axum HTTP server).
