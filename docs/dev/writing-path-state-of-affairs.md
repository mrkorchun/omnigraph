**Type:** archived architecture snapshot
**Status:** superseded 2026-08-06
**Historical surveyed state:** OmniGraph 0.9.0 development, internal manifest schema v19,
Lance 9.0.0
**Scope:** the direct-publish graph write path, its RFC-022–028 family,
adjacent control and maintenance operations, known blockers, and the next
decision points

**Change-set boundary:** this page describes current main through RFC-026's
Phase A foundation, historical private Phase B1 core, the Gate R0/near-cap
closure work, the B2a unbounded retain-all gate, the private B2
compare-and-chain/token-fold slice, the bounded v11/profile-v2 +
recovery-v13 profile-authority tranche, the hidden v12/lifecycle-v3 +
recovery-v14 quiescence tranche, v13/recovery-v15 private resume/guarded
drain-abort, the narrow v14/recovery-v16 checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices
capability, the distinct v15/recovery-v17 checked `SEALED` Optimize bridge,
v16/recovery-v18 checked offline physical rebind, v17/recovery-v19 cluster-only
terminal authority retirement and receipt-bearing export, and v18/recovery-v20
stopped/offline exact DataBlock correction, plus v19/token-schema-v3/
recovery-v21 deterministic terminal dead-letter folding and
three-disposition retirement, F6b5 served exact-cut export, and F6b6's
engine-internal checked operational-status cut.
RFC-024, RFC-025, and RFC-027 remain research-blocked at their recorded
evidence gates. Gate E0 first proved the bounded public Lance state classifier;
Phase A activated internal schema v7 with recoverable empty enrollment, durable
identity-keyed lifecycle authority, process-local admission/exclusion, and
strict format refusal/rebuild. Historical schema v8 added stream-config v2, a
root-scoped one-generation worker, watcher-backed durability followed by a
same-writer post-durability epoch check, exact replay/seal/retirement, and the
one-participant recovery-v11 fold. Gate R0 found that a legal high-entropy near-cap
generation could be acknowledged and materialized but could not fold because
shared-buffer capacity was charged instead of logical slice size. Admission,
replay, and fold now share `ArrayData::get_slice_memory_size` logical charging,
and fold rebuilds dense arrays with `take`; that exact shape
acknowledges, materializes, folds, and publishes. The measured RSS delta for
one exclusive full fold is 286,441,472 bytes (about 273 MiB). CI's 384-MiB
threshold is a remeasurement tripwire, not a runtime allocator or hard memory
limit.

Gate R0 historically rejected a *bounded, finite-lifetime* retain-all claim on
stock RC.1 because materialization has no durable attempt receipt or complete
physical-output envelope. We have deliberately dropped that claim. The first
profile is unbounded retain-all. Its private B2a gate is implemented: OmniGraph
never deletes a canonical durable MemWAL object, sets no retained-byte,
object-count, file-count, or history quota, and treats provider exhaustion as a
loud operational failure.
Lance may remove only a losing shard-manifest-CAS temporary staging object.
Complete and partial orphan output stays non-authoritative and is not descended
into, read, mutated, adopted, or deleted through retry/reopen; parent discovery
may still observe its prefix. Local and configured-RustFS provider-failure
tests pin those rules. The missing receipt/envelope therefore does not block
this profile. The 1/8/32/128 retained-history instrument keeps acknowledgement,
replay, fold, visibility, MemWAL, base-table, token-authority, other table-store,
graph-manifest, adapter, object, and RSS terms separate. The MemWAL warm-ack
operation counts are flat while exact authority lookup and combined history
work are reported separately and may grow; the aggregate is not claimed flat.
Timings, RSS, and LIST totals are advisory, not quotas or SLOs. Managed
reclamation remains optional Lance-owned work for a later profile; a
`GraphHistoryBudget` is not part of the immediate plan.

Internal schema v9 activates stream-config v3, lifecycle state-v2, trusted
hidden stream-row metadata, and a manifest-selected graph-global
`_stream_tokens.lance` authority. Private admission derives canonical payload
and compare-and-chain token digests, supports exact idempotent retry and
same-generation chains, and treats every pre-wait authority capture as
provisional: it recaptures schema, binding, lifecycle, HEAD, and token authority
after shared admission and same-key queue ownership. Recovery-v12 owns exact
base and token transactions; only their exact joint outcome may reach the sole
manifest CAS, which advances both pointers, lifecycle, lineage, and a durable
fold-attribution commitment together. Recovery-v11 is historical v8 state and
is refused under v9. The genuine v8↔v9 gate proves two-way refusal and strict
export/init/load rebuild without exporting hidden trusted metadata.

Internal schema v11 added profile protocol v2 plus exact recovery-v13
`StreamProfileChange`. Schema v12 replaces lifecycle state-v2's
inline histories with lifecycle-v3 fixed-size ledger heads and activates the
hidden recovery-v14 enrollment, writer-claim, ordinary/drain-fold, and
terminal-management families. Every cold opener and fold first publishes a
recovery-covered claim; its immutable attempt/checkpoint/terminal chain
authenticates the bounded WAL suffix and the full current-generation LWW
projection. A restartable hidden quiesce can take an enrolled lane
`OPEN → DRAINING → SEALED`, including the never-written empty case and the
non-empty fold case, without exposing an operator verb. Historical v10
enrollment and v12 lifecycle-v2 fold sidecars retain their exact wire meaning
and are refused under lifecycle-v3. V13 adds recovery-v15 for
crate-private receipt-first `SEALED → OPEN` resume and guarded `DRAINING →
OPEN` abort. The operation owns its higher-epoch physical claim and terminal
claim/management receipts before the sole `OPEN` publication. V14 adds
recovery-v16 for checked-runtime, canonical-main EnsureIndices while every
enrolled productive table is exactly `SEALED`; it atomically refreshes index
pointers and lifecycle proof without a token receipt or caller operation ID.
V15 adds the separate recovery-v17 Optimize bridge for internally
committing compaction/index-maintenance effects, exact achieved HEADs, and the
same atomic lifecycle-proof refresh. V16 adds recovery-v18 for an exact
offline `SEALED` physical rebind into a fresh empty binding scope that remains
`SEALED`; older incomplete resume/maintenance/rebind scaffolds remain frozen.
V17 adds recovery-v19 for the narrow stopped/offline, cluster-only
authority-retirement and receipt-bearing export exit. V18 adds
recovery-v20 for one exact blocked generation: the reconstructed winner set,
pre-minted base transaction, combined successor/receipt transaction, continued
`DRAINING` authority, system fold lineage, and operator receipts publish only
as one exact outcome. Current v19 upgrades current-token authority to schema v3
and adds recovery-v21: valid winners publish normally, losing terminal
candidates enter one bounded canonical object and become current
`DEAD_LETTERED`, an all-diverted cut advances through a marker-only base
transaction, and exact retry plus an ordinary successor preserve sequencing.
The same recovery version extends retirement to exact
`WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED` cuts.

Opaque checked stopped/offline apply and served-runtime owners bind canonical
cluster state, profile/declaration revision, actor, and runtime lifetime.
`DISABLING` persists an exact restart/resume plan with drain-only continuation
authority. Checked offline apply is the one active quiescence owner: it freezes
admission, drains a finite manifest-selected lane cut, and resumes that stored
plan after restart. F7a activates one graph-native served-ingress route and
remote CLI/OpenAPI contract; declaration routing and lazy lane enrollment stay
private. F7b activates one graph-redacted checked status route and remote CLI.
F7c activates selector-free graph-wide `SEALED → OPEN` resume and graph-wide
checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize through HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI.
Public lane enrollment, per-declaration/general lifecycle control including
abort-drain, rebind, and direct-SDK status/control remain inactive;
retirement,
`stream block show|correct`, and `stream dead-letter list|export` are the
narrow cluster-only CLI exceptions.

The RFC remains Draft. Row admission is reachable through the checked served
graph bridge at `POST /graphs/{graph_id}/stream/ingest`; its engine mechanics
remain private and feature-gated tests own their fault matrix. The graph-scoped
Cedar vocabulary, public manifest-only status, checked profile-control
boundary, and engine-internal checked operational-status cut exist. F7b exposes
the cut's graph-redacted served projection. F7c exposes only graph-wide resume
and checked `SEALED` maintenance, without a declaration/table/lane selector;
there is still no `@stream` syntax, public lane-enrollment/fold API,
per-declaration drain/resume/abort or rebind surface, direct-SDK checked
status/control, or fresh-read mode.

This page answers four practical questions:

1. What write-path architecture is actually implemented?
2. Which RFC decisions shipped, and which remain inactive?
3. What did implementation and measurement teach us?
4. What should we do next—and what should we deliberately not build yet?

It is an orientation document, not a second specification. Use
[invariants.md](invariants.md) for hard architectural rules and support
boundaries; the individual [RFCs](../rfcs/README.md) and
[review ledger](rfc-022-027-architecture-review.md) for decisions and acceptance
gates; [writes.md](writes.md) for current mechanics; [canon.md](canon.md) for
the narrative mental model; [lance.md](lance.md) for the pinned upstream
contract; and [testing.md](testing.md) for evidence ownership and commands.

## Executive judgment

The architecture is on the right track. The original write-path problem did
not require a new database inside OmniGraph; it required a disciplined
coordination layer over Lance:

- Lance owns table transactions, versions, branches, fragments, indexes,
  compaction, cleanup, and MemWAL.
- OmniGraph owns graph-wide authority, cross-table visibility, schema identity,
  validation, and recovery across independently committed Lance datasets.
- One `__manifest` commit is the only graph-content visibility point.
- Durable recovery ownership covers the gap between a Lance table effect and
  that manifest publication.
- Immutable, version-pinned state may be cached. Mutable authority is read or
  arbitrated durably; it is never supplied to a commit by an in-memory
  `GraphState`-like shadow.

The central chassis is implemented: [RFC-022](../rfcs/0022-unified-write-path.md),
[RFC-023](../rfcs/0023-key-conflict-fencing.md), and
[RFC-028](../rfcs/0028-stable-schema-identity.md) are complete at the documented
support boundary. The remaining RFCs are not a backlog to implement in numeric
order. RFC-024, RFC-025, and RFC-027 remain research-blocked. RFC-026 remains
strategic and Draft. Its production-neutral Gate E0 and Phase A foundation
passed their bounded gates. Internal schema v7 introduced exact main-only empty
MemWAL enrollment and local lifecycle exclusion; historical schema v8/config-v2
added one private no-rollover generation behind a root-scoped worker,
watcher-backed durability followed by a same-writer post-durability epoch check,
conservative replay, exact seal/retirement, and one recovery-v11 strict fold.
Schema v9/config-v3/state-v2 preserves that bounded worker and activates
the private compare-and-chain row/fold core: canonical digests, trusted hidden
attribution, graph-global manifest-selected token authority, and exact
base-plus-token recovery-v12. It admits and folds only exact already-normalized physical rows—including
already-normalized vector values—and neither calls an external embedding
provider nor invents unspecified derived fields. Native branch controls alone
may proceed at `SEALED`, because they do not move table HEAD. This remains a
private format/correctness core, not a streaming product: no production caller
can enroll, put, acknowledge, or fold a row. Gate R0 exposed two distinct
facts. First, the original accounting could reject one legal admitted near-cap
shape after durable acknowledgement; logical-slice accounting plus dense
rebuilding now closes that shape. Second, stock RC.1 cannot prove a lifetime
bound for materialization attempts or their complete physical growth. The
selected first profile makes no such claim. Its private B2a gate retains every
canonical durable MemWAL object without an OmniGraph retained-byte,
object-count, file-count, or history quota, accepts loud provider exhaustion,
keeps complete/partial orphan roots inert, and measures retained-history terms
locally and on configured RustFS.
Neither a test-only attempt ledger nor managed reclamation is on the immediate
activation path. V11/profile-v2 adds capability-bound profile control,
resumable `DISABLING`, and exact recovery-v13 profile receipts. V12 adds the
durable lifecycle ledger and recovery-v14 claim/quiesce/fold core. V13 adds
private recovery-v15 resume/guarded drain-abort. V14 adds the recovery-v16
`SEALED` EnsureIndices capability; v15 adds the distinct recovery-v17
`SEALED` Optimize capability; v16 adds the recovery-v18 private physical-rebind
capability; v17 adds recovery-v19 stopped/offline terminal authority retirement
and receipt-bearing export; v18 adds recovery-v20 stopped/offline DataBlock
correction; current v19/token-schema-v3/recovery-v21 adds deterministic bounded
mixed/all-diverted terminal folding, selected-token dead-letter list/export,
and three-disposition retirement. F6 measurement/guardrail acceptance and the
remaining explicit production contracts are next. B1's
adapter recheck contains a stale epoch from becoming a clean OmniGraph
acknowledgement; it is not a substrate retention/fencing primitive.

The largest remaining correctness boundary is topology: destructive recovery
is serialized across every handle in one process, but not against a live writer
in another process. OmniGraph must not advertise general multi-process writers
on one graph until a distributed fence closes that gap.

## The implemented correctness protocol

There is one correctness protocol with writer-specific physical adapters. It
does **not** mean every writer is forced through one identical Lance operation.

```text
resolve or refuse relevant recovery
    -> capture one immutable authority token and accepted catalog
    -> prepare and validate the complete operation
    -> acquire stream-admission domains
    -> StreamFold only: seal, drain, retire, and prove one immutable fresh-tier cut
    -> acquire schema -> branch -> stream-token -> sorted-table gates where applicable
    -> relist recovery and revalidate authority plus physical baselines
    -> durably arm an identity-bearing recovery intent
    -> apply writer-specific graph/table Lance effects
    -> exact adapters durably confirm the achieved outcome;
       Optimize retains a bounded complete-set classifier
    -> publish one graph-visible __manifest transition when needed
    -> delete the intent; a recovery resolution records an audit first
```

For the exact adapters, the authority token binds the facts that made planning
valid: the native Lance branch incarnation, exact optional graph head, accepted
schema identity, and relevant table versions/physical refs. A publisher may
retry a transient manifest CAS against that captured precondition. A semantic
full reprepare starts a new attempt instead of refreshing versions under an old
validation result; Optimize likewise reopens and replans a maintenance retry.

The five established graph-visible writer classes emit schema-v9 recovery
envelopes before their first independently durable effects. Current
lifecycle-v3 stream operations use recovery-v14 envelopes for exact
enrollment, claim, base-plus-token fold, drain-fold, and terminal-management
receipt effects. Historical v10 enrollment and v12 lifecycle-v2 fold payloads
remain decodable only so they can be refused under lifecycle-v3. Table ownership is
keyed by `(stable_table_id, table_incarnation_id)`, never inferred from an
alias, path, Lance version, or field ID. Mutation, Load, BranchMerge,
SchemaApply, and EnsureIndices use exact protocols in which `Armed` is
rollback-only and `EffectsConfirmed` may roll forward only under the captured
authority. A v14 fold is also exact, but its current ClaimReceipt and immutable
fresh-tier cut are proved before arm: only the exact planned base plus token
outcome may publish both pointers, lifecycle-v3 successor, lineage, and
attribution. An exact base-only outcome may complete only the pre-minted token
transaction; foreign, buried, token-only, or ambiguous partial outcomes fail
closed. Recovery-v11 is historical v8 syntax and is refused under v9 and later.
Optimize is the deliberate exception: its v9 envelope carries identity-bound
pins and a bounded complete-set maintenance classifier, with no exact
authority/fixed-lineage confirmation phase, because Lance exposes no
caller-minted maintenance transaction. Mutation and Load share one writer
adapter but retain distinct sidecar/audit kinds, so the established five
classes map to six `SidecarKind`s`; bounded enrollment is the seventh and
the recovery-v14 stream family occupies the later closed variants. No stream
adapter is reachable from a supported production API.
Foreign, buried, or ambiguous effects fail closed.

The sidecar is not a second WAL or transaction log. Lance remains the owner of
table transactions and durable data. The sidecar records the authority,
ownership, intended graph delta, and evidence needed to resolve the temporary
gap between those Lance effects and graph visibility.

### Implemented write adapters

| Writer | Physical adapter | Visibility and recovery posture |
|---|---|---|
| Mutation / load | One staged keyed or overwrite transaction per touched table; deletes stage too | Exact transaction identities, fixed lineage, and one final manifest publish. Effect-free insert/upsert contention may fully reprepare only under the typed rules; any owned or ambiguous effect becomes `RecoveryRequired`. |
| Branch merge | A bounded ordered chain of filtered inserts/upserts/deletes per changed table | One v9 intent covers physical effects, pointer-only updates, first-touch refs, and the complete merge delta. The target is never silently reparented after planning. |
| SchemaApply | Metadata-only pure type rename, exact staged rewrite for property/schema changes, or strict first-touch create | The fixed schema identity, table delta, lineage, and source/IR/state promotion are one recoverable outcome. Every supported rename preserves logical identity and table lifetime; only a pure type rename also preserves Lance version/index history. Drop/re-add does neither. |
| EnsureIndices | One staged mixed `CreateIndex` transaction per productive table | Indexes remain derived state. Exact transactions and the complete pointer delta publish once; untrainable vector work stays pending instead of breaking logical writes. |
| StreamSealedEnsureIndices (hidden F3b capability bridge) | The same exact mixed `CreateIndex` transaction per productive table; no `_stream_tokens` write | One recovery-v16 intent layers the enabled profile, selected token witness, and complete prior/next `SEALED` lifecycle rows over recovery-v8's effect plan. Under the retained checked runtime and sorted exclusive admission, one CAS publishes every index pointer and proof refresh. It has no caller operation ID or ManagementReceipt; residual recovery settles before natural replanning, and no-work stays effect-free. |
| Optimize | Lance compaction, incremental index optimization, and missing-index materialization across productive tables | One graph-wide v9 envelope and at most one monotonic manifest/lineage publish. Provenance is bounded rather than exact because Lance does not expose a caller-minted maintenance transaction surface. |
| StreamEnrollmentV2 (hidden lifecycle-v3 foundation) | Lance's public internally committing singleton MemWAL initializer, one pre-minted empty shard, and immutable enrollment/binding receipts | One v14 intent owns the physical index/shard effects and the exact token-ledger transaction, then selects binding, ledger heads, and `OPEN` lifecycle together. Once a physical effect exists it rolls forward only. Historical v10 enrollment retains its old wire meaning and is refused under current lifecycle-v3. |
| StreamClaim (hidden lifecycle-v3 writer authority) | The shard manifest claims a higher writer epoch and, for epoch ≥ 2, records Lance's zero-batch fence sentinel; bounded WAL replay derives the exact authenticated suffix and full current-generation LWW projection | One v14 intent owns the attempt/checkpoint/terminal claim-receipt chain. The terminal receipt and manifest-selected current-claim head publish together under the complete stream write-gate envelope. Restart discovers and continues the exact pending lane claim before minting another. |
| StreamFoldV2 / StreamDrainFold (hidden lifecycle-v3 fold core) | After a current recovery-covered claim, exclusive admission seals and proves one exact empty or non-empty cut; a non-empty generation becomes one exact staged keyed base transaction plus one exact staged `_stream_tokens.lance` transaction | One v14 intent binds the current ClaimReceipt, authenticated tail, both prestates and transactions, full next lifecycle-v3 state, fixed lineage, and attribution. Only exact base + exact token publishes. Exact base-only may complete only the pre-minted token effect; token-only, foreign, buried, or mixed effects fail closed. `StreamDrainFold` additionally binds the active drain operation. |
| StreamLifecycleReceipt (hidden lifecycle-v3 terminal management) | One exact immutable terminal-management receipt in `_stream_tokens.lance`; the empty path has no fake base fold | One v14 intent selects the receipt and the lineage-neutral `SEALED` lifecycle transition atomically. A restart after seal reuses the exact receipt-bound physical cut instead of claiming a new epoch. |
| StreamResume (hidden resume / guarded drain-abort) | Under closed admission, Lance claims a higher writer epoch and the exact terminal ClaimReceipt plus ManagementReceipt land in one token-ledger transaction | One recovery-v15 intent binds the complete prior lifecycle/profile/topology, request, binding, attempt, and receipt plan. Only the canonical `OPEN` row may publish; receipt-first retry returns the durable outcome. Rebind and `SEALED` maintenance are not variants of this adapter. |
| StreamProfileChange (bounded profile authority) | One exact `ProfileManagementReceipt` transaction in manifest-selected `_stream_tokens.lance` | One v13 intent fixes the old/new protocol-v2 profile and exact receipt transaction. Only the achieved receipt witness plus fixed next profile may publish at the sole manifest CAS. `DISABLING` is resumable; unknown v13 variants fail closed. |

### Explicit adjacent paths

These operations do not create a side door around the protocol:

| Operation | Why it is different |
|---|---|
| Native graph-branch create/delete | Lance `BranchContents` is the sole logical authority. Create/delete use a smaller authority-derived control protocol, emit no graph lineage, and reconcile clone-tree/ref crash gaps within the single-writer-process boundary. |
| Repair | Repair is main-only and does not manufacture a new table effect. It classifies already-uncovered HEADs and publishes selected adoptions together in one manifest/lineage commit after explicit operator confirmation; suspicious or unverifiable drift additionally requires force. |
| Cleanup | Cleanup is destructive physical version GC, not graph publication. It refuses unresolved recovery and uncovered main-HEAD drift, protects lazy-branch inherited main versions, and performs graph-wide preflight before fault-isolated per-table GC. The CLI requires confirmation; the public engine method executes the requested cleanup directly. |

## What is done

| Area | Implemented state |
|---|---|
| Publication surface | The historical Run state machine and `__run__*` staging branches are gone. The graph-write storage surface is crate-private, sealed, and staged-only; source guards make a new durable gateway an explicit review event. |
| Lineage | `graph_commit` and `graph_head` live in `__manifest` and land in the same CAS as table pointers. The former secondary commit-graph datasets are retired. |
| Mutation / load | Multi-statement writes accumulate in `MutationStaging`, provide read-your-writes, stage deletes as well as constructive writes, and publish once after complete validation. D2 deliberately keeps one query constructive or destructive. |
| Identity / schema | Accepted SchemaIR v2 owns graph-scoped, monotonic, no-reuse type/property/incarnation IDs. Supported renames preserve logical identity and table lifetime; a property rename rewrites that lifetime, while only a pure type rename also preserves physical/index history. Drop/re-add mints a new lifetime. The strict strand serves only internal schema v19 and upgrades by export/init/load rebuild. |
| Key fencing | Every graph table has exact non-null physical `id` as Lance's unenforced PK. Strict insert/upsert use the sealed exact-`id` filtered adapter; bare keyed Append is forbidden; effect-free conflicts have typed reprepare or `KeyConflict` outcomes. |
| BranchMerge | The ordinary ordered diff remains the correctness path. A completely verified `omnigraph.insert_absence = "v1"` history permits the proven-insert shortcut without committing Append or weakening the final filter. |
| Validation | Value, enum, uniqueness, edge-RI, and cardinality use one catalog-derived, delta-scoped evaluator across mutation, load, and merge. Committed non-key uniqueness probes are batched by constraint group and bounded chunks. |
| Recovery | Same-process handles share ordered queues for the same canonical local root or identical normalized opaque remote/custom URI. Stream-admission domains are acquired outside profile-shared → schema → branch → stream-token → table gates where applicable. Mutation/load, SchemaApply, BranchMerge, EnsureIndices, Optimize, active v14–v21 stream operations, StreamProfileChange, and `refresh` heal roll-forward-only; Repair and Cleanup refuse pending recovery, while branch controls use specialized barriers. Read-write open performs the quiesced full sweep, including v14 enrollment/claim/fold/terminal-receipt, v15 resume/abort, v16 SEALED EnsureIndices, v17 SEALED Optimize, v18 SEALED physical rebind, historical v19 two-disposition retirement, v20 exact `DataBlock` correction, v21 terminal fold/three-disposition retirement, and v13 profile-receipt completion; read-only open never repairs and refuses unresolved stream recovery. Historical recovery-v10 enrollment, v11 B1 fold, v12 lifecycle-v2 fold, and v14 resume/maintenance/retirement/rebind are refused. A resolved graph-lineage intent is audited internally with the original actor when present; retirement instead uses its selected immutable receipt/profile chain and emits no graph lineage or `RecoveryAudit`. No-effect cleanup need not create graph lineage. |
| RFC-026 Phase A (v7 foundation) | Internal schema v7 introduced identity-keyed lifecycle rows and exact empty main/unsharded enrollment. At that Phase-A-only boundary, any lifecycle row—including `SEALED`—rejected base-table, schema, maintenance, repair-adoption, and recovery effects under a process-local admission lease because no drain/fold witness-update adapter existed. Native branch create/delete alone could proceed at `SEALED` because it did not move table HEAD; `OPEN`/`DRAINING` refused it. Enrollment and open-time validation rejected named-branch overlap and any uncovered lifecycle/MemWAL mismatch. Current v19 preserves these foundation guarantees while adding the guarded lifecycle-v3 claim/fold/quiesce/resume transitions and explicit SEALED EnsureIndices/Optimize/rebind bridges. |
| RFC-026 Phase B1 (historical private core) | Internal schema v8/config-v2 added one root-scoped, cross-handle serialized worker and a hard-bounded 8,192-row/32-MiB logical dense-slice Arrow no-roll generation. Watcher success proves durability; a clean `DurableBatchAck` additionally requires the same `ShardWriter::check_fenced()` to succeed immediately afterward. Fence loss, epoch-read failure, owner-task failure, or deadline ambiguity is post-invocation `AckUnknown` plus worker retirement. Reopen/replay is conservative and exact drain proof precedes quiesced abort. Gate R0's deterministic legal high-entropy near-cap cell exposed sparse scanner arrays; logical-slice charging plus dense copies repaired it. Physical RSS is evidence only. V9 preserves those worker/closure mechanics, but recovery-v11 itself is historical only. |
| RFC-026 B2 token/fold core + profile/lifecycle authority + F7 graph surface | Internal schema v9/config-v3/state-v2 adds canonical payload/token digests, hidden trusted row metadata, exact idempotency and compare-and-chain classification, same-generation token overlays, and post-admission authority recapture. `_stream_tokens.lance` is graph-global durable sequencing state selected only by its manifest witness. V11/profile-v2 adds checked stopped/offline and runtime ownership, resumable `DISABLING`, fail-closed `RETIRED`, and exact recovery-v13 profile receipts. V12/lifecycle-v3 replaces inline histories with fixed-size ledger heads; recovery-v14 covers enrollment, writer claims, ordinary/drain folds, and terminal management receipts. V13–v20 add private resume, SEALED maintenance/rebind, authority retirement, and DataBlock correction. Current v19/token-schema-v3/recovery-v21 adds deterministic terminal diversion and extends retirement to `WITHDRAWN | DEAD_LETTERED`. The private one-lane core can cycle `OPEN → DRAINING → SEALED → OPEN`; checked offline apply is the supported `OPEN/DRAINING → SEALED` owner. F7a exposes graph-native served row admission over absent or `OPEN` lanes while keeping lane enrollment private. F7b exposes a graph-redacted read-only projection of F6b6's checked cut over HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI. F7c exposes selector-free graph-wide resume plus graph-wide checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize over HTTP/OpenAPI and the remote CLI, reusing recovery-v15/v16/v17 without a new coordinator or format. Public lane enrollment, per-declaration/general lifecycle control including abort-drain, rebind, and direct-SDK status/control remain inactive. F6b5 separately activates exact-terminal served HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI export with bounded transport ownership. F6b6 implements the underlying checked read-only operational cut with explicit checked `DISABLING` authority and complete pending-sidecar inventory inside a hard advisory envelope: 256 matching direct `.json` sidecars, 256 irrelevant direct-or-nested objects encountered below the prefix, 4 MiB of cumulative input-anchored URI bytes across all encountered objects, 32 MiB per sidecar body, and 32 MiB of cumulative bodies. Exceeding any bound is a typed refusal, never partial status. The cut retains honest recovery/unavailable physical evidence and unavailable cold-replay/flushed/oldest-age fields. Retirement, DataBlock inspection/correction, and selected current dead-letter list/export remain narrow cluster-only CLI controls. F6 owns remaining measurements and guardrail acceptance. |
| Lance access | One process-wide `ObjectStoreRegistry` reuses clients. Each `Omnigraph` handle owns its cached data-table `Session`; one process-wide zero-cache control `Session` opens mutable tips. Only the object-store registry is shared between the data and control sessions. This is “cache the past, never the present,” not one global cached session. |
| Maintenance | EnsureIndices stages exact missing-index transactions. Its checked-runtime recovery-v16 path can refresh an enrolled table only at exact `SEALED`; Optimize coordinates graph-wide compaction/index work under one bounded recovery envelope, and recovery-v17 applies the same checked-runtime, exact-`SEALED` pointer/proof refresh. F7c exposes both only as selector-free graph-wide HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI controls with aggregate results; ambient/direct calls remain refused for enrolled tables. Recovery-v18 separately rebinds an exact `SEALED` lane without opening it and remains private. Periodic optimize compacts `__manifest`, but unmaintained history-dependent paths are not globally flat. |

Selected enforced limits are 8,192 rows / 32 MiB per keyed Mutation/Load table,
8,192 rows / 32 MiB of logical dense-slice Arrow bytes for the complete private
stream generation (physical RSS remains an evidence tripwire), at most 32
pre-effect full reprepares, 8,192 rows / 32 MiB per BranchMerge chunk, one
aggregate 32-MiB retained merge-validation budget, at most 1,024 logical data
transactions per merged table, and a 1,026-version exact-recovery scan bound.
Optimize defaults to eight physical tasks and a five-attempt compaction retry
budget. This is not the complete constants catalog. The important loud outcomes
are `KeyConflict`, `ReadSetChanged`, `RecoveryRequired`, `AckUnknown`, and
`ResourceLimitExceeded`; none reports partial success.

## RFC implementation state

| RFC | Current disposition | What that means now |
|---|---|---|
| [022 — Unified graph-write protocol](../rfcs/0022-unified-write-path.md) | **Implemented** | The shared correctness state machine, per-writer adapters, recovery barrier, one visibility point, control exceptions, and test lattice are the stable chassis. Completion is scoped to one writer process per graph for destructive recovery. |
| [023 — Key-conflict fencing](../rfcs/0023-key-conflict-fencing.md) | **Implemented** | Internal schema v6 introduced exact-`id` PK metadata, closed keyed routing, typed conflicts, bounded replay, rebuild/refusal, and accepted performance evidence; v19 preserves that contract. |
| [024 — Durable table heads](../rfcs/0024-durable-table-heads.md) | **Research-blocked** | The first in-manifest BTREE candidate has a specified logical contract and flat indexed row/range work, but fails the complete physical-I/O gate. No head rows or heads format are active. |
| [025 — Checkpoint retention](../rfcs/0025-checkpoint-retention.md) | **Research-blocked** | Lance tag/pin semantics pass, but the proposed in-manifest registry access shape is not history-flat after compaction. No checkpoint rows, `ogcp_` production tags, API, or cleanup integration are active. |
| [026 — MemWAL streaming ingest](../rfcs/0026-memwal-streaming-ingest.md) | **Draft; graph-native served row ingress, graph-redacted status, graph-wide resume/SEALED maintenance, hidden lane/fold/lifecycle core, narrow cluster/offline controls, and exact-terminal served export implemented** | Schema v9 introduced config-v3/state-v2 token authority plus recovery-v12 exact base+token fold. V11–v21 add checked profile/lifecycle ownership, recovery-covered claims/quiesce/resume/maintenance/rebind/correction/retirement, deterministic terminal folds, exact retry/ordinary successor, and selected-token inspection. Historical recovery payloads retain their exact grammar. F6b3/F6b7 provide uncovered and failpoints-only paired reconciled token-index evidence; F6b7 records a bounded standalone-reconciler NO-GO for the uncompacted profile-cycle fixture, so recovery-owned token-index maintenance remains open only to new evidence (including graph-manifest-compacted/checked-Optimize coupling). F6b4 closes the dead-letter envelope; F6b5 connects the move-only exact-terminal cut to existing HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI export with strict chunk/queue ownership; F6b6 implements the checked read-only operational core; F7b exposes its graph-redacted HTTP/OpenAPI/remote-CLI projection. F7c exposes selector-free graph-wide resume and checked `SEALED` EnsureIndices/Optimize over the same served transports. Direct-SDK status/control and remaining guardrails stay open. Checked offline disable is the supported production quiescence owner. F7a activates one graph-level mixed node/edge NDJSON row route and remote CLI/OpenAPI contract over the existing lazy private-lane prepare and resident driver. Public lane enrollment, per-declaration/general lifecycle control including abort-drain, and rebind remain inactive. B2b managed reclamation remains optional future work. |
| [027 — Lineage merge deltas](../rfcs/0027-lineage-merge-deltas.md) | **Research-blocked** | The desired O(delta) classifier and fallback contract are specified. Selective live-row and deletion-delta discovery are not yet bounded, so `OrderedTableCursor` remains the correctness path. |
| [028 — Stable schema identity](../rfcs/0028-stable-schema-identity.md) | **Implemented** | Rename-stable IDs, table incarnation, identity-derived paths, schema/recovery integration, and strict rebuild activation were introduced in v5 and remain active in v19. |

## Blockers and constraints discovered

| Frontier | Evidence and current consequence | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| Distributed recovery fence | Process-local queues cannot stop a live foreign process; Lance restore may orphan its commits and native refs lack conditional compare-delete. Supported destructive recovery remains one writer process per graph. | A separately designed and adversarially tested distributed fence before multi-process writers, background compensation, or cross-process exact maintenance recovery. |
| History-flat authority | RFC-024/025 show flat BTREE rows/ranges/pages can coexist with history-growing manifest discovery or compacted bytes. No heads/checkpoint format is active; mutable tip caches and a second authority remain rejected. | A new Lance-native access shape—or revised measured operational contract—passes the original cold/warm, compacted/uncompacted, local/object-store gate. |
| Internal history GC | Safe live-writer cleanup needs a durable resurrection/retention boundary; otherwise a stalled writer can recreate a collected version. | An evidence-backed cleanup watermark/fence before automated `__manifest` version GC. |
| MemWAL delivery and closure | RC.1 initializes the system index and claims shards as separate effects without a caller-minted combined receipt or cross-process seal. Phase A recovers that gap exactly for main-only, one-shard, one-live-writer-process empty enrollment. At the row boundary, the durability watermark is writer-wide while batch positions reset after MemTable rollover, `put_no_wait` may mutate before returning `Err`, replay leaves its fresh BatchStore WAL watermark unset, and `wait_for_flush_drain` can lose a completed failure before a late waiter snapshots it. Neither batch positions nor WAL statistics are durable receipts. The private v9 slice now closes compare-and-chain sequencing, trusted attribution, stale-authority admission, and exact base+token fold recovery. | Implement and prove explicit production enrollment, revisioned lifecycle management, bounded correction/status, authorization, cancellation/shutdown, and product parity before adding a public caller. A public receipt/seal or accepted distributed fence remains the exit for overlapping processes and failover, not for the current single-live-writer-process profile. |
| MemWAL retained growth | A clean retained generation has measurable current objects, and the Gate R0 sweep proves that referenced currently listed immutable paths retain their class and size at one/four/eight folds. RC.1 still provides no durable cross-open attempt cap, complete physical-output receipt, or provider-billed-byte inventory. That prevents OmniGraph from promising a finite retained-storage bound. | Private B2a implements the deliberately unbounded profile: never delete a canonical durable `_mem_wal` object, keep complete/partial orphan subtrees non-authoritative and untouched below their roots through retry/reopen, impose no retained-byte/object/file/history quota, and fail loudly if the provider refuses further writes. Lance may remove only its losing manifest-CAS temp staging. The 1/8/32/128 local/RustFS instrument records separate advisory terms and shows combined retained-history work grows; it does not create a bound. Add attempt ledgers or physical-growth reservation only if a later profile claims bounded retention. |
| MemWAL reclamation (optional B2b) | Stock RC.1 exposes evidence-level raw listing and manifest reads, not a complete classified inventory or safe MemWAL delete/GC primitive. Generic `cleanup_old_versions` leaves `_mem_wal` unchanged. Worse, deleting the successor's empty WAL fence sentinel can let a stale writer complete a WAL PUT and report watcher success because RC.1 has no post-success epoch check. Private B1 contains that result for its own acknowledgement but cannot retract durable bytes or protect raw Lance callers. Raw path deletion in OmniGraph remains forbidden. | Keep B2b as optional Lance-owned durable inspect/plan/execute, attempt/receipt recovery, post-success fencing, bounded history checkpoint, strong inventory/accounting, and enforced-watermark work. It is not on the immediate retain-all activation path. |
| O(delta) merge | A version-column predicate is still O(rows) without a selective source, and deleted rows have no live version columns. Full ID differencing remains correct. | Bounded live-row and deletion/change discovery, exact shadow agreement, and a table-size-flat one-row-delete gate. |
| Optimize provenance | Compaction/reindex has no stable caller-minted transaction covering the complete effect. Optimize therefore uses bounded, not exact, provenance. | Both an upstream maintenance transaction API and distributed recovery fencing. |
| Remaining bounds/operations | Some long-running operations lack complete memory/time budgets; rollback waits for quiesced read-write open; recovery audit has no public query. | Incremental, independently owned hardening without widening format or topology. |

RFC-026's bounded implementation separates two facts that earlier wording
incorrectly collapsed. The enrollment binding is stable: logical
table/incarnation, location/main ref, never-reused enrollment/shard IDs, and
configuration. The public Lance composite of branch identifier, current table
version, transaction UUID, and manifest e_tag is a mutable
`CurrentHeadWitness`; every ordinary commit changes it. While a bounded stream
is `OPEN`, only fold/recovery may advance that base HEAD, and the next witness
must publish atomically with the table pointer. Other writer/control/
maintenance paths touching the table refuse pre-effect or drain first. Gate E0
proved the classifier and witness model with complete direct-probe and
object-store evidence; Phase A established the reversible support restriction.
The private worker consumes it for one nominally bounded generation, watcher-backed
durability plus the same-writer post-durability epoch check, replay, and strict
folding without pretending the process-local lease is a distributed fence,
inventing a durable WAL offset, or reusing a watcher across rollover. Fence
loss or uncertainty after durability is `AckUnknown`, never a clean ack. Gate
R0 exposed a sparse-buffer closure gap; the dense-copy repair closes the exact
legal near-cap shape without changing admission. V9 then adds durable
compare-and-chain authority: post-wait recapture prevents a stale admission,
same-generation overlays preserve exact retry/ordering, and recovery-v12 makes
the base and token effects one manifest-visible outcome with fold attribution.
Those results authorize neither raw MemWAL reclamation, a public product, nor a
broader topology.

The full known-gap ledger, including adjacent local-CAS and unsupported
multi-version-topology details, remains in
[invariants.md#known-gaps](invariants.md#known-gaps).

## How Lance 9.0.0-rc.1 influenced the plan

RC.1 mostly validated the direction and sharpened gates. It did not justify a
write-path redesign.

| RC.1 finding | Planning effect |
|---|---|
| Lance surfaces consumed by RFC-022/023—transactions, branches, key filters, staged indexes, compaction, and shared sessions—remain compatible; separately surveyed tag/cleanup behavior is also unchanged | Keep the current architecture. PR #364 passed 22 surface guards and 129 runnable failpoint tests; the Gate-0 follow-up adds the 23rd guard plus checkpoint cost evidence. No format redesign is needed. |
| Derived MemWAL datasets inherit the base store parameters and `Session`; `put_no_wait` returns an optional watcher whose completion is `Result<()>`, not a durable row coordinate. RC.1's watcher watermark spans the writer while active-MemTable batch positions reset on rollover; `put_no_wait` can also mutate before a later scheduling error. Replay leaves the fresh BatchStore watermark unset, and a late `wait_for_flush_drain` can miss a completed failure. | Shared-session propagation removes one integration concern, but the watcher is safe only inside B1's proved single-generation lifecycle. B1 treats watcher success as necessary durability evidence, then requires the same writer's `check_fenced()` to succeed before clean acknowledgement. Every post-invocation error or ambiguity is `AckUnknown`; rollover remains prevented, the public replay-watermark bridge handles fold-only reseal, generation proof comes from refs plus authoritative manifest state, and the writer retires/reopens before another generation. This does not create an exact combined enrollment receipt or cross-process seal. MemWAL is strategic, not experimental. |
| Generic cleanup ignores `_mem_wal`, and RC.1 does not recheck the writer epoch after a successful WAL PUT | B1 contains the clean-ack stale-epoch result for its own private caller by rechecking after watcher success and retiring on any fence/read ambiguity. The selected retain-all profile performs no raw-path collection, so generic cleanup's non-ownership is expected. B2b keeps Lance-owned reclamation, post-success fencing, durable receipts, inventory/accounting, and an enforceable growth reservation as optional future work; it does not block unbounded retain-all. |
| Experimental, opt-in `DataOverlay` was added | Do not adopt it now. OmniGraph does not enable feature flag 64 or emit the operation; unknown foreign overlay effects remain fail-closed. DataOverlay's experimental status says nothing about MemWAL's status. |
| RC.1 expands Lance write rejection from the three row-address names to all five surveyed virtual system-column names | OmniGraph now rejects `_rowid`, `_rowaddr`, `_rowoffset`, `_row_created_at_version`, and `_row_last_updated_at_version` during parsing and accepted-IR validation. A beta.21 development graph using a newly reserved row-version name must be exported with beta.21, renamed, and rebuilt. |
| A genuine ordinary-schema beta.21 V2_2 graph forward-opened, queried, and merge-wrote under RC.1 | No general storage-format migration. The reserved-name exception is explicit rather than hidden behind a format bump. |
| RFC-024's 10/100/1,000 run added a bounded one-operation boundary while the rejected compacted-byte slope remained | Durable heads stay research-blocked; do not weaken the gate. The RC made the no-go slightly clearer, not the design more attractive. |
| A separate RFC-025 Gate-0 follow-up run on the RC.1 pin—not part of PR #364—found the same complete-I/O problem for checkpoint authority | Keep the logical checkpoint/tag ordering, reject the current access shape, and stop before production format/API work. |
| Maintenance still has no caller-controlled exact transaction | Optimize's bounded adapter and single-writer-process recovery boundary remain necessary. |
| DataFusion moved 53 -> 54; Arrow and explicit V2_2 stayed stable | Mechanical dependency/type alignment, not an architecture change. |
| RC.1 requires Rust 1.91+ and remains a git-pinned prerelease | Continue the full alignment audit on every bump. Crates.io/stable release work remains gated on Lance 9 stable. |

The matched merge-all-changed diagnostics were effectively neutral: RC.1 was
about 0.6% slower at 10K and 1.9% at 100K in single matched runs, with similar
or slightly lower incremental RSS. That is not a roadmap signal.

## Next logical steps

### Now

1. **Keep the B1 closure and B2a retain-all evidence as permanent regression
   gates.** The exact 8,192-row high-entropy shape must continue to acknowledge,
   materialize, fold, and publish locally and on configured RustFS. Provider
   failures must remain typed; complete/partial orphan roots must remain inert;
   canonical durable MemWAL deletion must remain zero; and older retained roots
   must receive zero IO. Keep 384 MiB as a CI remeasurement tripwire for the
   isolated fold RSS delta, not as a runtime allocation promise or a retained-
   storage limit. Treat 1/8/32/128 LIST, timing, and RSS results as advisory.
2. **Finish the remaining B2 control plane privately.** Preserve the existing
   request-idempotent first-use enrollment, authoritative status, persistent
   quiesce, and v15 revisioned resume/abort-drain receipts; next add the
   separate same-binding maintenance/rebind shape and bounded
   `REPLACE`/`WITHDRAW` correction on the v9 token/fold authority already in
   place. Keep every step under recovery and the manifest visibility CAS. Do
   not add a storage quota, materialization-attempt ledger,
   `GraphHistoryBudget`, or raw `_mem_wal` deletion.
3. **Add product surfaces last.** Only after those private lifecycle,
   correction/status, and crash/race gates are green should schema intent, SDK,
   HTTP, CLI, Cedar, OpenAPI, and shutdown ownership converge on the same core.
4. **Keep B2b managed reclamation independent and optional.** If a bounded
   profile is scheduled later, author Lance-owned durable inspect/plan/execute,
   attempt/receipt recovery, post-success epoch fencing, strong inventory or
   durable accounting, and an enforced retained-storage watermark. A
   graph-global `GraphHistoryBudget` would require its own RFC and every-writer
   evidence. Never delete `_mem_wal` paths from OmniGraph.
5. **Keep RFC-024/025/027 stopped at their research no-gos.** Their blockers are
   independent of the v9 stream core; do not add RFC-024 heads, RFC-025 graph
   checkpoint rows/format, or RFC-027 lineage-delta state as incidental B2
   work.
6. **Give a distributed recovery fence its own design and evidence gate.**
   Define authority, expiry/renewal, fencing tokens, and crash semantics before
   implementation; require adversarial multi-process tests on local and object
   storage.
7. **Continue low-risk v9 hardening.** Add missing resource/time budgets,
   preserve cost-at-history-depth gates, and reduce constant factors only where
   the existing authority model remains intact.
8. **Coordinate upstream without making it the calendar.** The additional
   Lance asks are replay initializing the per-MemTable WAL watermark, drain
   completion that cannot lose a finished error, recoverable MemWAL
   enrollment/admission, conditional native ref operations, exact maintenance
   transaction provenance, and a bounded deletion/change-lineage source.

### Only when an evidence trigger fires

- **Public MemWAL row activation:** Phase A passed its bounded gate; the private
  v9 core now covers near-cap closure, unbounded retain-all, canonical
  compare-and-chain sequencing, trusted attribution, and exact base+token
  folding. The RFC remains Draft and public activation remains off until
  request-idempotent explicit enrollment, strict correction/disposition,
  persistent revisioned lifecycle with bounded management receipts, authorization,
  schema/SDK/API/CLI parity, cancellation ownership, and authoritative status
  pass their gates. Retained storage has no OmniGraph byte/file/history limit;
  provider exhaustion fails loudly. The exact upstream enrollment receipt/seal
  remains the preferred simplification and broader-topology gate, not a
  dependency for the current one-live-writer-process profile.
- **Durable heads or checkpoints:** when a new current-authority access shape
  exists, run the full decision instrument before adding production rows or a
  format stamp.
- **Lineage merge deltas:** when both live-row and deletion discovery are
  selective, shadow the new classifier against the existing truth-table path
  and prove cost flat in table size.
- **Exact Optimize provenance:** when Lance exposes the required maintenance
  transaction and the distributed fence exists, replace the bounded adapter
  rather than layering another classifier beside it.
- **Lance 9 stable:** repeat the full upstream diff/spec audit, surface guards,
  compatibility proof, failpoint suite, and cost instruments. Do not infer
  stable behavior from RC.1 by name alone.

## Explicit non-goals for the next slices

Do not:

- build a custom WAL, lock table, transaction manager, or buffer pool;
- restore a mutable in-memory graph tip as commit authority;
- create a second heads/checkpoint authority merely to escape the measured
  manifest-access cost;
- implement RFC-024, RFC-025, or RFC-027 production paths behind a nominal
  feature flag before their blocking gate closes;
- treat the private schema-v9 token/fold core as permission to expose a put/ack
  endpoint before explicit enrollment, correction, persistent lifecycle/status,
  authorization, and product-parity contracts are implemented and evidence-green;
- delete or rewrite `_mem_wal` objects from OmniGraph, or interpret generic
  Lance version cleanup as MemWAL reclamation;
- permit a base-table writer to advance any Phase A lifecycle's HEAD (including
  `SEALED`) before the Phase D witness-update/rebind adapter exists,
  or use a long-lived enrollment tag without first measuring retained files and
  bytes across rewrite/compaction/cleanup;
- treat process-local gates or exact transaction UUIDs as a distributed fence;
- infer table ownership from aliases, paths, matching versions, or compatible
  schemas;
- give mutable control datasets the same cached-session policy as immutable
  version-pinned data; or
- use private Lance APIs to make an upstream lifecycle gap appear closed.

Decision instruments and production correctness tests serve different purposes:
a green no-go-preservation test means the rejected result was reproduced, not
that the candidate became shippable. RFC-026 Gate E0 is green at a precise
boundary. Fourteen substantive local cells cover the state/negative matrix,
buried-effect refusal, and the exact-version cost proof; baseline versions 8
and 80 have the same complete six-attempt shape (four successful HEADs, one
`NotFound` HEAD, one successful GET) with zero lists. A Unix permissions
tripwire distinguishes exact probing from latest enumeration and forces an
unreadable exact HEAD to error. The configured RustFS cell passes non-vacuously
with the same zero-list shape and the declared positive plus listing-dependent
negative matrix; separate surface guards own S3 ABA and the doc-hidden Lance
surfaces. Phase A subsequently used that proof to activate v7 lifecycle,
recovery, exclusion, and refusal/rebuild. No acknowledgement or fold activation
followed from either gate alone. Private B1 passed its separate gate: the
complete graph-level admission/fold/crash suite now includes post-watcher epoch
loss as `AckUnknown` plus retirement, and the historical v7-source → CURRENT
refusal/rebuild evidence remains green. The post-containment local warm-ack result stays
flat at 9 reads / 219 bytes; configured RustFS retains only its 2026-07-19
pre-containment baseline and requires rerun before a current object-store
ack-cost claim. Gate R0 first exposed, and the repaired regression cell now
closes, the deterministic high-entropy near-cap shape: acknowledgement and
materialization are followed by one successful fold and manifest publication.
The one/four/eight-fold census and source audit still prove that current LIST
cannot establish a lifetime/provider-billed bound and that RC.1 has no durable
attempt cap or reserve-first complete-output envelope. Those are accepted facts
for unbounded retain-all, not blockers. Private B2a now adds the structural no-
delete guard, shared strict classifier, local/configured-RustFS complete-orphan
provider matrix, local partial-orphan matrix, and 1/8/32/128 cost sweep. Older
roots receive zero IO, canonical durable MemWAL delete requests remain zero,
and only Lance's exact losing manifest-CAS temp staging may be removed. Warm ack
operation shape stays flat while serialized authority and combined retained-
history work grow; those measurements are advisory and create no ceiling. The
private v9 token/fold suite additionally pins canonical digests, typed binding/
sequence/idempotency conflicts, exact retry, same-generation chaining,
post-admission stale-authority refusal, exact two-participant recovery, and
durable fold attribution. The historical final-v8-source → CURRENT cell proves
strict two-way refusal and rebuild fidelity while excluding hidden trusted metadata
from export. The RFC remains Draft. F7a activates graph-native served rows and
F7b activates a graph-redacted checked driver/rebuild-status projection;
F7c activates selector-free graph-wide resume and checked `SEALED`
EnsureIndices/Optimize. Per-declaration/general lifecycle control, rebind,
direct-SDK status/control, and raw physical-status transports remain inactive.
F6b5 is the other narrow transport exception: the existing
served HTTP/remote-CLI/OpenAPI export route
accepts an exact cluster-served terminal cut with bounded transport ownership.
F6b6 implements the checked operational-status core behind an engine-internal
seam. Its full immutable token/base and receipt preflight runs without writer
gates; a short second phase validates the same selected cut and repeats only
mutable physical/recovery witnesses. A moved base HEAD is unavailable only
when an exact canonical-main recovery participant outcome owns that movement.
B2b's two additional guards prove why stock
RC.1 generic cleanup and raw successor-fence-sentinel deletion cannot implement
a later managed profile; they are a no-go boundary for reclamation, not for
retain-all.

## Updating this page

Update this page when any of the following changes:

- a new graph-visible writer or control-path exception is added;
- recovery ownership, support topology, or the manifest visibility boundary
  changes;
- the internal schema or strict rebuild contract changes;
- an RFC moves between draft, research-blocked, accepted, and implemented;
- a Lance bump changes a consumed surface or closes an upstream gate;
- a cost instrument reverses a no-go or reveals a new history-dependent term;
  or
- a known gap is closed or promoted into the public support contract.

Keep detailed mechanics in [writes.md](writes.md), numeric evidence in the
owning RFC/test, and public behavior in the relevant [user docs](../user/index.md).
This page should remain the shortest accurate answer to “where is the write path
now, and what should we do next?”
