# Branch-merge algorithmic complexity

**Type:** investigation artifact (complexity + object-store cost)
**Status:** living reference for timeout diagnosis
**Audience:** anyone debugging slow / timed-out `branch_merge`
**Upstream surveyed:** Lance 9.0.0 (`v9.0.0` / `7653c206`)
**Companion docs:** [merge.md](merge.md) (correctness / routes),
[testing.md](testing.md) (`merge_cost.rs`, `merge_fast_forward.rs`),
[lance.md](lance.md)

This document answers: for each function on the merge path, what is its
asymptotic cost in CPU/memory **and** object-store requests? Merges timeout
when the wrong route is selected, when history/fragments are uncompacted, or
when Lance's full-table `merge_insert` join is paid per keyed chunk.

## Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `T` | Catalog / table-key universe for the merge (union of base/source/target) |
| `TΔ` | Tables whose manifest state differs between source and target |
| `N` | Live rows in one table image (base / source / target as labeled) |
| `Δ` | Changed / new / deleted rows for one table |
| `C` | Keyed chunks for one table: `ceil(Δ / 8192)` and also cut by 32 MiB; hard cap **1024** |
| `V` / `K` | Lance versions in a source interval `(base_version, source_version]` |
| `H` | Append-only `__manifest` history depth / fragment count (uncompacted) |
| `F` | Fragments in a data table |
| `I` | Index metadata entries on a data table |
| `B` | Blob payload bytes materialized |
| `D` | Branch ancestry depth (`BranchIdentifier` mapping length) |
| `R` | Commit / publisher retry attempts |

Hard OmniGraph bounds (refuse before sidecar arm when crossed):

- `KEYED_WRITE_MAX_ROWS = 8_192`, `KEYED_WRITE_MAX_BYTES = 32 MiB`
- `MAX_BRANCH_MERGE_DATA_TRANSACTIONS = 1_024` per table
- `PURE_INSERT_HISTORY_MAX_VERSIONS = 1_024`
- Operation-wide retained validation delta: **32 MiB** projected scalars

## Route selection (the dominant complexity switch)

```
branch_merge_as
  └─ branch_merge_impl                    # authority, merge-base, recovery gate
       └─ branch_merge_on_current_target  # classify → validate → arm → publish → CAS
            for each changed table_key (sequential, sorted):
              if source == target: skip
              if source == base:   skip (target already has source)
              if target == base:   classify_adopt  → AdoptPureInserts
                                                   | AdoptWithDelta
                                                   | AdoptSourceState
              else:                stage_streaming_table_merge → RewriteMerged
```

| Route | When | Dominant cost |
|---|---|---|
| **`AdoptPureInserts`** | Target equals merge base **and** complete Lance txn chain proves exact-`id` pure inserts | Scan Δ source rows + `C` join-free commits. **Best path.** |
| **`AdoptWithDelta`** | Target equals base, proof misses, HEAD-advancing | Full sorted scan of **base+source** + per-chunk `MergeInsert` with **`use_index(false)`** (full target join) |
| **`AdoptSourceState`** | Pointer switch / first-touch fork | O(1) pointer or native ref create; optional validation delta still scans base+source |
| **`RewriteMerged`** | Target diverged from base (true three-way) | Full sorted scan of **base+source+target** + eager signatures + same fenced keyed writes |

Untouched tables are skipped after `same_manifest_state` checks. Tables are
processed **sequentially** — no cross-table parallelism.

## End-to-end complexity by phase

### A. Outer prepare — `branch_merge_impl`

| Step | Location | Time | Object-store |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy + schema-apply idle | `merge.rs` `branch_merge_as` | O(1) + Cedar | control reads |
| Recovery sidecar list | `recovery.rs` | O(sidecars) | `LIST` + `GET` per sidecar |
| Source+target authority | `omnigraph.rs` `open_merge_write_txns` | warm: O(1) probe; cold: **O(H + T)** | latest-version probe **or** `__manifest` open+full scan |
| Merge-base over commit vectors | in-memory | O(H) | none |
| Historical base snapshot (diverged) | `ManifestCoordinator::snapshot_at` | **O(H + T log T)** | one historical `__manifest` open + full fold |
| Merge-exclusive mutex | swap active coordinator | serializes concurrent merges | — |

Checked cost ceilings (`merge_cost.rs`): common fast-forward ≤ **3** internal
opens / **3** manifest scans; diverged ≤ **4** / **4**. Scan **count** is
capped; each scan still folds **O(H)** journal rows, so
`manifest_reads` **grows with history** on uncompacted graphs.

### B. Classification — per changed table

#### `try_proven_pure_insert_admit` / `try_proven_pure_insert_adopt`

`merge.rs` ~678. Opens base+source, walks `(base, source]` transaction
metadata, checks pure `Operation::Update` shape + exact-`id` filter + full
nested schema preorder + physical row total.

| | |
|---|---|
| Time | **O(K + fields + plan_scan(Δ))** with `K ≤ 1024` |
| Object-store | 2 dataset opens; **≈ K** version-location probes + manifest/txn GETs (`Dataset::read_transaction_by_version`); then one bounded source-interval scan for chunk planning |
| Miss | Any gap / cleaned txn / unfamiliar op → fall through to `compute_adopt_delta` |

#### `plan_proven_pure_insert_chunks`

Scans `_row_created_at_version ∈ (base, source]` through the bounded
normalizer. **O(Δ + B)**; emits exact chunk row counts for recovery pre-mint.

#### `compute_adopt_delta` (fallback adopt)

`merge.rs` ~1154. Two lazy `OrderedTableCursor`s over base and source.

| | |
|---|---|
| Time | **O(N_base + N_source)** scan + **O(σ_matched)** signatures only for ids on both sides |
| Staging | **O(Δ + B)** into temp Lance datasets (inserts + upserts) + delete-id chunks |
| Memory | Two scanner batches (≤ 8 192 rows / 32 MiB requested) + writer buffer ≤ 32 MiB + delete plan ≤ 32 MiB |

#### `stage_streaming_table_merge` (three-way)

`merge.rs` ~1253. Three **eager**-signature cursors over base, source, target.

| | |
|---|---|
| Time | **O(N_base + N_source + N_target)** + **O(σ_all)** signatures for every row of every side |
| Staging | Only **changed** result rows + deletes (Δ-scoped publish payload) |
| Conflict detection | Signature equality among `{base, source, target}` |

### C. `OrderedTableCursor` and `row_signature`

```397:411:crates/omnigraph/src/exec/merge.rs
            Some(Box::pin(
                crate::table_store::TableStore::scan_stream_bounded(
                    ds,
                    None,
                    None,
                    Some(vec![ColumnOrdering::asc_nulls_last("id".to_string())]),
                    true,
                    KEYED_WRITE_MAX_ROWS,
                    KEYED_WRITE_MAX_BYTES,
                )
```

Lance upstream (`scanner.rs`):

- `order_by` docs: *“all data must be read before the first batch can be returned.”*
- Plan inserts DataFusion **`SortExec`** → wall-clock **O(N log N)** sort work
  and high memory/spill risk before any merge progress.
- Unsorted scan would be O(N) I/O; the sort adds the log factor and TTFP delay.

`row_signature` (`merge.rs` ~1484) stringifies **every non-`_row*` column**,
including **Vector embeddings**. Cost per row ≈ O(columns + serialized bytes).
On the three-way path this runs for **every** base/source/target row (eager).
On adopt fallback it runs only for matched ids (lazy).

### D. Validation — `validate_merge_candidates`

Δ-scoped since the post-#5 evaluator. Does **not** open untouched catalog
tables (`merge_cost.rs::merge_validation_is_delta_scoped`).

| Step | Cost |
|---|---|
| Project out Vector/Blob; retain id/src/dst/scalars | O(Δ_projected); **32 MiB** aggregate cap |
| Unique / RI / cardinality probes | Chunked 8 192-key index-backed lookups against target |
| Missing index | Falls back to scans (correctness preserved, cost rises) |

Pure identity-key fast-forward with only `@key` can skip validation entirely
(`proven_fast_forward_needs_no_validation`).

### E. Recovery arm + physical publish

| Step | Cost |
|---|---|
| Pre-mint exact Lance txn identities | O(C) per table; refuse if C > 1024 |
| Sidecar write | 1 object `PUT` |
| Publish loop | **Sequential over tables**, then sequential over chunks |

#### `publish_proven_pure_insert_adopt` (cheap publish)

- Source-interval scan **O(Δ + B)**
- Per chunk: `InsertBuilder` stages fragments (**no target probe / no join**),
  then commit of filtered insertion-only `Update` with v1 certificate
- Object-store ≈ **O(C)** data PUTs + **O(C)** commit CAS pairs
- Explicitly **`strict_insert_preflight_calls == 0`**,
  **`stage_merge_insert_calls == 0`**

#### `publish_adopted_delta` / `publish_rewritten_merge_table` (expensive publish)

For each chunk:

1. StrictInsert exact-probes the pinned parent, then stages the shared
   join-free insertion-only `Update`.
2. Upsert uses Lance `MergeInsertBuilder` with **`use_index(false)`**.
3. Commit uses transparent retries disabled (exact identity).

```1914:1917:crates/omnigraph/src/table_store.rs
        // Beta.21's scalar-index v1 route omits the key filter.  Force v2 and
        // assert the resulting transaction shape below so a future Lance
        // routing change fails closed.
        builder.use_index(false);
```

For Upsert, Lance `create_joined_stream` with `use_index(false)` takes
`create_full_table_joined_stream`: DataFusion **full (or left) hash join of the
entire target table** against the source chunk
(`merge_insert.rs` ~1006–1036). Indexed path is available upstream but OmniGraph
**deliberately disables it** so the transaction carries the exact-`id`
`KeyExistenceFilter` (RFC-023). Consequence:

> **Per Upsert chunk cost ≈ O(N_target + chunk)** join/scan work, not O(chunk).**
> With `C = ceil(Δ/8192)` changed-row chunks, publish pays roughly
> **C × O(N_target)**.**

StrictInsert runs an exact `id IN (...)` preflight per insert chunk
(**O(indexed lookup)** when BTREE covers `id`; else scan), then writes only the
new fragment — it no longer pays a redundant target join.

Deletes: one `DeleteBuilder` per chunk with `id IN (...)`. Best case indexed
lookup O(q + A + Fa); without usable scalar index, **O(N)** filter scan +
O(F) fragment walk for deletion vectors.

All merge routes defer missing-index work to `ensure_indices` / `optimize`.

### F. Manifest CAS + cleanup

| Step | Cost |
|---|---|
| Confirm sidecar | Per-effect HEAD/txn probes O(C); rewrite sidecar `PUT` |
| `publish_with_precondition` | Up to **5** retries; each loads full `__manifest` **O(H + T)** |
| `merge_rows` into `__manifest` | One Lance merge-insert (`use_index(false)` again) on pending rows |
| Delete sidecar | 1 `DELETE` |

## Lance substrate costs (not in OmniGraph source)

Surveyed from `/tmp/lance-src/lance` at `v9.0.0` and full docs under
`format/table/{transaction,layout,branch_tag,row_id_lineage}` and
`guide/{read_and_write,object_store,performance,observability}`.

| OmniGraph call | Lance API | Complexity | Typical OS pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open pinned table | `DatasetBuilder::with_version` / `checkout_version` | Parse **O(F+I)** | 1 manifest HEAD/GET |
| Open branch HEAD | `with_branch` / `checkout_latest` | + latest resolution | branch JSON GET; latest via hint **O(1–K)** or list **O(V)** |
| Sorted `id` scan | `scan().order_by(id).batch_size(8192).batch_size_bytes(32MiB)` | **O(N log N)** `SortExec`; TTFP after full sort input | Data page GETs for all projected columns |
| Tx history `(base, source]` | `read_transaction_by_version` loop | **O(K)** | ≈ K manifest + ≤ K `_transactions` GETs |
| Stage append | `InsertBuilder::execute_uncommitted` | O(M) rows | Data file PUTs |
| Keyed StrictInsert | exact preflight + `InsertBuilder` fragments converted to filtered `Update` | indexed preflight O(M·lookup), worst O(N), then O(M) write | preflight index/scan GETs + data PUTs |
| Keyed Upsert | `MergeInsertBuilder` **`use_index(false)`** | **Full-table join O(N+M)** per execute | Full target scan GETs + write PUTs + deletion PUTs |
| Indexed MergeInsert (unused) | `use_index(true)` when every ON col indexed | O(M + lookups + candidates); but **v1 omits key filter** | Index page GETs |
| Source replay in indexed path | `ReplayExec(Capacity::Unbounded)` | Holds **entire source** in memory | — |
| Delete `id IN (...)` | `DeleteBuilder` | Indexed O(q·lookup+A+Fa); else **O(N+F)** | Scan/index GETs; deletion GET/PUT |
| Commit | `CommitBuilder::execute` | Per attempt **O(K + F + I)**; × retries | `_transactions` PUT + manifest conditional PUT/rename; default timeout **30 min** |
| Branch create | shallow clone + `_refs/branches/*.json` | Metadata O(F+I); **two-phase non-atomic** | Manifest write + branch JSON PUT |
| `find_referenced_version` | `BranchIdentifier` prefix compare | **O(D)** CPU | none |
| Index bitmap update | `fields_for_preserving_frag_bitmap` | Metadata O(I·Fa) | manifest only |
| AIMD object-store throttle | cloud stores | Can stretch wall-clock under S3 503s | Retries look like timeouts |

Docs (`guide/performance`): **manifest-level** ops scale with fragment count;
**fragment-level** ops (update/delete/`merge_insert`) scale with fragment size.
Tens of thousands of fragments are “generally fine”; very high `F` still taxes
every open/commit/plan.

## Worked timeout scenarios

### 1. Large diverged three-way on a vector-heavy table

1. `stage_streaming_table_merge` sorts+scans base, source, **and** target
   (`3 × O(N log N)` TTFP + I/O).
2. Eager `row_signature` stringifies embeddings for all three sides.
3. Publish runs one full-table `merge_insert` join per changed-row Upsert
   chunk against the growing target.

**Symptom:** merge stuck with high CPU / S3 GET volume before sidecar confirms;
timeouts common when `N` is millions and embeddings are wide.

### 2. Fast-forward that **misses** the pure-insert proof

Missing/cleaned `_transactions`, schema-preorder mismatch, or `K > 1024`
falls to `compute_adopt_delta` + `AdoptWithDelta`. Insert chunks exact-probe
the target and stage join-free, but classification still pays the full sorted
base/source scans.

**Symptom:** “simple” branch with only inserts is slow; instrumentation shows
`ordered_cursor_scan_calls > 0`, `stage_fenced_insert_calls == C`,
`strict_insert_preflight_calls == C`.

### 3. Uncompacted `__manifest` / deep history

Fixed number of coherent scans (3–4) but each folds **O(H)** fragments. On
RustFS/S3, `manifest_reads` grows with depth (`merge_manifest_cost_grows_with_history`).
Worse when publisher retries after concurrent writers.

**Symptom:** even tiny deltas time out on old graphs; `optimize` on `__manifest`
flattens this (write-path already gates post-compaction flatness).

### 4. Many tables changed, sequential publish

`TΔ` tables × (classify + validate + C commits) with **no parallelism**.
A multi-table review branch pays sum of per-table costs.

### 5. Blob-heavy rows

Declared external sizes are checked pre-arm (aggregate 32 MiB); still **O(B)**
payload reads during staging/publish. One oversized blob fails closed before
effects.

## Instrumentation map

`MergeTimingPhase` (`instrumentation.rs`):

`OuterPrepare` → `ProvenInsertHistory` → `ProvenInsertPlanScan` →
`CandidateValidation` → `FinalRevalidation` → `RecoveryArm` →
`PhysicalPublish` (`KeyedStage` / `KeyedCommit`) → `RecoveryConfirm` →
`ManifestPublish` → `RecoveryCleanup` → `OuterRestoreRefresh`

Structural probes to classify the route of a timed-out merge:

| Probe | Proven path | Expensive path |
|---|---|---|
| `ordered_cursor_scan_calls` | 0 | ≥ 2 (adopt) or ≥ 3 (three-way) |
| `stage_fenced_insert_calls` | C | C_insert |
| `stage_merge_insert_calls` | 0 | C_upsert |
| `strict_insert_preflight_calls` | 0 | C_insert |
| validation projected bytes | often 0 (identity-only FF) | ≤ 32 MiB |

## Highest-leverage correctness-by-design fixes (validated)

Ranked by leverage against the timeout tax × assumption risk × whether the
fix closes a class rather than papering over an instance. Validated against
OmniGraph main, RFC-023 / RFC-0001 / RFC-027, and Lance 9.0.0 (`v9.0.0`; tip
of `origin/main` still has `inserted_rows_filter: None // not implemented for v1`
on the indexed MergeInsert route).

### L1 — After absence is proven, drop the MergeInsert join (StrictInsert) — implemented

**Fix.** Once `preflight_strict_insert_ids` (or equivalent) has proven the
chunk's keys absent at the pinned parent, stage with the existing
`stage_proven_strict_insert` shape (`InsertBuilder` fragments + filtered
insertion-only `Update` + exact-`id` `KeyExistenceFilter`), not
`MergeInsertBuilder` with `use_index(false)`.

**Why this is correctness-by-design.** RFC-023 §5.2 already states the
complete-history proof makes the target merge join *redundant*;
`certify_insert_absence` documents that a strict preflight **or** an all-new
MergeInsert result is the same absence proof. Today's general StrictInsert
pays the proof **and then** the O(N) join anyway — a class of wasted work the
design already declared unnecessary. Closing it removes **`C × O(N_target)`**
from every StrictInsert surface (Mutation/Load Append **and** merge
`AdoptWithDelta` inserts), not only one caller.

**Assumptions (must hold):**

1. Preflight is against the **same pinned parent** that becomes
   `transaction.read_version`.
2. OCC for concurrent same-key writers is carried by the exact-`id`
   `KeyExistenceFilter` on the pure-insert `Update` (same compatibility class
   as forced-v2 MergeInsert) — already the proven-path contract.
3. `fields_for_preserving_frag_bitmap` remains the **full nested schema
   preorder** (silent index over-claim otherwise).
4. Stable row IDs remain on; blob URI cells stay materialized (proven adapter
   rejects external refs).
5. Does **not** by itself make Upsert or three-way classification cheap.

**Invalidates if:** Lance conflict resolution ever treats manually-minted
filters differently from MergeInsert-emitted ones (surface guards must keep
pinning equality). Bloom false positives stay typed read-set / internal, never
silent duplicates (already RFC-023).

### L2a — Partition adopt publish by classification disposition — implemented

**Fix.** On `AdoptWithDelta` the ordered walk already partitions ids into
**new / changed / deleted**. Drive physical ops from that partition:

| Disposition | Before | Implemented op |
|---|---|---|
| New | StrictInsert → full-table MergeInsert | L1 join-free filtered insert |
| Changed | insertion-capable forced-v2 Upsert | update-only MergeInsert (`UpdateAll` + `DoNothing`), indexed v1 when `id` coverage exists, v2 fallback otherwise |
| Deleted | `DeleteBuilder` | unchanged |

L2b may extend `RewriteMerged` by splitting the three-way selection the
same way (target absent → insert; target present → update) instead of one
undifferentiated Upsert stream.

**Why this is correctness-by-design.** Classification already proved
presence/absence relative to the merge base; when `target == base` (adopt) or
when the three-way walk observed target membership, re-joining the whole
target to rediscover that fact is a second, weaker mechanism. One mechanism
(partition + disposition-matched Lance op + read-set revalidation) replaces
two.

**Assumptions:**

1. Final gate revalidation still proves target incarnation / HEAD equals the
   classification baseline before sidecar arm (`ReadSetChanged` otherwise).
2. Changed-id sets are **disjoint** from insert sets (true today by the single
   ordered walk).
3. The update uses a **full-row rewrite** of the staged image (merge already
   stages full rows). Indexed v1 carries no inserted-row filter; v2 fallback
   carries `Some(empty)`. A non-empty filter is rejected because the
   transaction must insert nothing. Conflict coverage is `affected_rows`.
4. Missing `id` index coverage falls back to v2's full join, so correctness
   never depends on physical index state (invariant 7).
5. The sealed `KeyedWriteSemantics::KnownPresentUpdate` enum arm reuses the
   existing staged gateway; callers cannot express Lance actions directly.

**Invalidates if:** a future classifier emits "changed" without proving the id
exists on the publish baseline, or partial-column updates are introduced
without updating conflict metadata.

**Review addendum (2026-08-12):** the indexed (v1) update route is additionally
gated on a frag-bitmap proof — Lance's v1 full-schema update arm emits
top-level-only `fields_for_preserving_frag_bitmap`, which in principle can let
an index on a nested field id silently claim rewritten fragments.
**Empirically verified on Lance 9.0.0:** the hazard does not materialize for
OmniGraph-shaped schemas — BTREE/FTS/vector index metadata all reference
top-level field ids (a FixedSizeList child has no field id), and a direct
v1-route UpdateAll test showed zero new-fragment claims. The checked-in
`indexed_update_only_route_leaves_rewritten_fragments_uncovered` Lance guard
now pins that contract before the production arm enables the indexed route.
Details and the full assumption-by-assumption review ledger:
[merge-l1-l3-plan.md](merge-l1-l3-plan.md) → "Review ledger".

### L3 — Defer `RewriteMerged` inline index build (align with adopt + deny-list) — implemented

**Fix.** Stop calling `build_indices_on_dataset` on the three-way publish path;
leave coverage to `ensure_indices` / `optimize`, exactly as `publish_adopted_delta`
already documents.

**Why this is correctness-by-design.** Invariant 7 + deny-list: physical
acceleration must not gate logical publish; adopt path already instantiates
that rule. Three-way's inline IVF/FTS/BTREE is the inconsistency that puts
`O(N log N)` / `O(N·dim)` on the timeout-critical path for embedding tables.

**Assumptions:**

1. Reads remain correct under partial coverage (already guaranteed).
2. Recovery must not treat a missing index tail as required for merge
   success (adopt already accepts this; three-way's "CreateIndex tail" headroom
   in the scan ceiling becomes unused for the happy path).
3. Operators still run maintenance; this is convergence, not omission of the
   logical contract.

### L4 — Widen insert-absence admission when history is cleaned

**Fix.** When `try_proven_pure_insert_adopt` misses only because `_transactions`
were GC'd / cleaned, but classification shows **insert-only** delta and
`target == base`, admit the join-free publish from the **revalidated**
classification proof (or from L1 after a single chunked preflight), and mint
v1 so the next generation composes.

**Why this is correctness-by-design.** Today's miss converts an all-new
fast-forward into `AdoptWithDelta` + full joins — an optimization hole that
changes cost class without a logical reason. The durable certificate remains
the composition mechanism; classification/preflight is the admission evidence
when history is absent.

**Assumptions:**

1. Miss reason is distinguishable (cleaned history vs unfamiliar op vs
   non-insert delta). Unfamiliar ops must still fall back.
2. `K > 1024` remains a hard optimization budget, not silently unbounded work.
3. Same L1 OCC / preorder / stable-row-id assumptions.

### L5 — Upstream: indexed MergeInsert emits `KeyExistenceFilter` (RFC-023 option 2)

**Fix.** Consume a Lance revision where the indexed path sets
`inserted_rows_filter` (today still hardcoded `None` on 9.0.0 and current
`main`). Then production may set `use_index(true)` and keep fencing.

**Leverage.** Unlocks O(lookup) joins for **all** keyed Upserts (mutation +
merge), not only merge adopt. Highest cross-surface payoff once shipped.

**Assumptions:**

1. Filter field IDs and Bloom semantics match forced-v2 exactly (surface
   guards).
2. Indexed path still uses `ReplayExec(Capacity::Unbounded)` — large source
   chunks can OOM before S3 is the bottleneck; chunk caps (8 192 / 32 MiB)
   remain mandatory.
3. Partial index coverage must fail closed to full join or refuse — never
   under-match.
4. Until upstream lands, **do not** flip `use_index(true)` — that reopens the
   unfiltered-writer conflict class RFC-023 closed.

### L6 — Fragment adopt for `AdoptWithDelta` (draft RFC-0001)

**Fix.** Graft source fragments via `base_paths` instead of row copy; re-home
in `optimize`; reclaim guard before branch GC.

**Leverage.** Removes classify+copy+join+reindex for the common
target-equals-base divergent case — the production OOM/timeout shape RFC-0001
names. Does **not** fix `RewriteMerged` (explicitly deferred; needs #7263 or a
different algorithm).

**Assumptions (heavier / partly irreversible):**

1. Cross-dataset `base_paths` GC protection is implemented by OmniGraph
   reachability **or** Lance #7514/#7515/#7185 land.
2. Single-writer-process boundary (or a lease) until distributed fencing exists.
3. On-disk layout commitment: target manifests reference branch trees until
   re-home.
4. Index adopt is Phase 2 / evidence-gated; Phase 1 may still rebuild via
   reconciler (compatible with L3).

### Explicitly lower leverage or blocked

| Idea | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Cheaper `row_signature` / skip embedding stringify only | **Symptomatic** for publish OOM (RFC-0001): helps detect, does not remove copy/join. Still worth as a **secondary** classify-CPU win after L1–L3. |
| RFC-027 lineage O(Δ) classify | **Research-blocked** on a sublinear **deletion-delta** source; without it, delete discovery stays O(N). Do not remove `OrderedTableCursor` on hope. |
| Cross-table parallel publish | Separate design; single recovery sidecar / one CAS today. |
| `optimize` `__manifest` | **Operational** lever, high practical value, not a merge-design fix. |
| Wait only for Lance #7263 native branch merge | Correct end state for L6; not a substitute for L1–L3 which need no format change. |

### Recommended sequence

Implementation plan (PR slices, tests, L2 staged-Update blocker):
[merge-l1-l3-plan.md](merge-l1-l3-plan.md).

1. **L3** first (independent) — deny-list alignment; removes vector build from three-way critical path.
2. **L1** — sealed join-free StrictInsert after preflight; helps Mutation/Load and merge.
3. **L2a** — adopt known-present update adapter; then optional **L2b** three-way split.
4. **L4** — recover cleaned-history fast-forwards onto L1.
5. **L5** when Lance ships; keep forced-v2 until guards pass.
6. **L6** when reclaim/GC assumptions are closed (RFC-0001).

Instrument each with existing probes: `stage_merge_insert_calls` must fall to 0
on StrictInsert-after-preflight and on partitioned adopt inserts;
`stage_fenced_insert_calls` rises; three-way must show zero inline vector index
builds after L3.

## What this investigation intentionally deprioritizes

Relative to clarity of the cost model:

- **Cross-table parallel publish** — correctness/recovery envelopes are
  single-sidecar; parallelism is a separate design.
- **Shipping `use_index(true)` before L5** — would drop fencing.

Near-term timeout relief without design work remains: keep merges on
**`AdoptPureInserts`**, compact `__manifest`/data tables (`optimize`), and
avoid unnecessary three-way divergence. Design work should start at **L1**.
